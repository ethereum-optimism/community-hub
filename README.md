## Contributions

Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) page for specifics on how to write PRs, use the linter, run spellcheck, add dictionary terms, etc. You should also review the [Optimism Documentation Style Guide](/pages/connect/contribute/style-guide.mdx) for additional guidelines, especially if you are writing entirely brand new pages to the developer docs, as opposed to smaller edits and/or revisions.
