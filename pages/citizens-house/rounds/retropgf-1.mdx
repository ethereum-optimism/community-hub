# Retro Funding Round 1

The Optimism Collective’s first round of Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding) took place in Q4 of 2021. 
This round was the first Retro Funding  experiment of the collective and was [announced](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retropgf-experiment-1-1-million-dollars-for-public-goods-f7e455cbdca) in the months following the [initial blog post on Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c). 
Retro Funding 1 allocated $1M to **fund projects that have provided value to the Optimistic Ethereum ecosystem.** 

## Results
