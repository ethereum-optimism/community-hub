## **Voting**

ðŸ‘‰ Voting was live from September 30th - October 14th.

The thesis behind Retro Funding 5 was that guest voters with subject-matter expertise would be able to better understand and vote on a given projectâ€™s impact.

This round sorted Badgeholders into smaller groups dedicated to evaluating a specific set of applications. A number of guest voters with expertise relating to the OP Stack were selected, to test if there are significant differences in how experts versus non-experts vote to allocate rewards to OP Stack contributions. You can find out more about the round's governance design [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-expert-voting-experiment/8613).

Process Overview:

1. Subgroups were established: voters were randomly assigned into subgroups.
2. Category allocation: All voters voted on the allocation of OP among the three categories of the roundâ€™s scope. These votes are public.
3. Impact Evaluation: Each voter voted on the amount of retro rewards all projects within their assigned category should receive. Votes were private to prevent intimidation and coercion, promote unbiased decision-making and protect against bribery.

Badgeholders can find all the information relevant for voting in the [Badgeholder Manual.](https://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-5-badgeholder-manual/8877)
