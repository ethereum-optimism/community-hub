# Eligibility Framework and Principles

The Citizens' House relies on a carefully designed eligibility framework aimed at achieving representation from key stakeholders in the Superchain ecosystem. This framework is built on the following principles:

1. Those who are most impacted by protocol upgrades should have governance power over them
2. Those who contribute most to shared resources should have a voice in the governance of those shared resources

Eligibility criteria include three distinct stakeholder groups within the Citizens' House:

1. Chains
2. Onchain Applications 
3. Superchain End-Users

This evolution is designed so that governance power is distributed among those with the most at stake in the ecosystem's success, creating a more balanced and representative governance system.

The eligibility criteria for each group are designed to:

- Identify significant Superchain stakeholders
- Be transparent and understandable
- Rely on objective, measurable data
- Be resistant to gaming or manipulation

## Citizenship Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility is recalculated at the beginning of every Season, and criteria are subject to change.

## Chain Citizens

### Eligibility Criteria in Season 8

Chains are eligible to vote in the Citizens' House if they meet either of these criteria:

- Account for at least 2% of the total revenue share contributed by all chains in the past Season
- Are among the top 15 chains by revenue contribution in the past Season

Eligibility for Season 8 is calculated based on activity from 01 January 2025 - 31 May 2025. The list of eligible chains in Season 8 is found here.

This approach aims to give chains with significant economic stake in the ecosystem  a voice in governance, while the minimum number of seats (15) should mean broad representation even if revenue becomes concentrated.

## App Citizens

### Eligibility Criteria

Onchain applications are eligible to join the Citizens' House if they meet either of these criteria:

- Are responsible for at least 0.5% of the total gas used across the Superchain over the past Season
- Are among the top 100 apps by gas usage in the past Season

Eligibility for Season 8 is calculated based on activity from 01 January 2025 - 31 May 2025 based on contract data registered by projects in OP Atlas. Projects/contracts not registered in OP Atlas cannot be considered at this time. The list of eligible apps in Season 8 is found here.

This approach aims to give applications driving significant activity on the Superchain a voice in governance, while the minimum number of seats (100) should mean broad representation from the application ecosystem.

## End-user Citizens

### Eligibility Criteria

Individual end-users are eligible to join the Citizens' House if they meet all of these criteria:

- Had their first Superchain transaction before June 1, 2024
- Have at least 2 Superchain transactions each month in at least 3 distinct months from 01 December 2024 - 31 May 2025
- Can provide proof of personhood through [World ID](https://world.org/world-id) or [Passport](https://app.passport.xyz/)

To check the eligibility of your address, navigate to [atlas.optimism.io/citizenship](http://atlas.optimism.io/citizenship)

These criteria are designed so that Citizens will be genuine, active users of the Superchain with sustained engagement over time, rather than one-time or sporadic users.

### Selection Process

The selection process for Consumer Citizens includes:

1. Verification of a user's transaction history against the activity criteria. Users must link an eligible address to their Atlas profile
2. Verification of proof of personhood
3. Potential additional verification for accounts flagged as suspicious

The number of User Citizens is capped at 1,000 in Season 8, with this number used in quorum calculations.

Until Sybil-resistance mechanisms are more mature, the Optimism Foundation may suspend Citizens flagged as possible Sybils and request further verification of unique personhood.

## Participation requirements

To maintain the integrity of the Citizens' House, several important rules govern participation:

1. **No Double Representation**: If you are an admin of a Citizen project or organization, you may not also join the Citizens' House as a Superchain user.
2. **Organization Priority**: An organization and a project under that organization can never both get votes in the Citizens' House. If both are eligible, membership defaults to the organization.
3. **No Multiple Accounts**: It is forbidden to create multiple accounts to attempt to get multiple votes in the Citizens' House as a Superchain user. In Season 8, Citizens will be manually reviewed for possible Sybil activity by the Optimism Foundation.
4. **Seasonal Recalculation**: The eligibility criteria for being a member of the Citizens' House will be recalculated every Season and may change—being a Citizen now doesn't guarantee future Citizens' House membership.

These rules help ensure that the Citizens' House remains balanced, representative, and resistant to capture or manipulation.
