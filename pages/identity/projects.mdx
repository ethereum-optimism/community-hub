## Projects

Within the Optimism Collective, [the project entity](/identity/project-and-individual-identity/#people) represents contributions to the Optimism Collective and can be used to apply for Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding).
## Project Representation

The project entity is represented onchain by an attestation from the [following schema](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xff0b916851c1c5507406cfcaa60e5d549c91b7f642eb74e33b88143cae4b47d0). Projects are identified by the type "project". The attestation UID serves as the project's unique identifier throughout its lifecycle in the Collective.

## Project metadata

All other project metadata is stored or referenced in the [Project Metadata Attestation](https://optimism.easscan.org/schema/view/0xe035e3fe27a64c8d7291ae54c6e85676addcbc2d179224fe7fc1f7f05a8c6eac).

### Updating metadata

*   The Project Metadata Attestation is re-issued whenever there's a change in metadata.
*   Apps displaying project metadata should refer to the most recent attestation for up-to-date information.
