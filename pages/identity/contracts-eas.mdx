# EAS contracts

This guide covers [Ethereum Attestation Service ("EAS")](https://attest.sh), an open-source public good that is included as a predeploy in the OP Stack.
It also covers EAS contract addresses, how to read and write attestations, and indexing.

## EAS contract addresses

The [Ethereum Attestation Service](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/welcome) is deployed on these addresses:

| Network    | Attestation Contract                                                                                                                   | Schema Registry Contract                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OP Sepolia | [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021) | [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000020](https://sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000020) |
| OP Mainnet | [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000021)       | [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000020](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000020)       |

## How to read and write attestations

You can read and write attestations in several ways:

*   [EAS scan user interface (OP Mainnet)](https://optimism.easscan.org)
*   [EAS scan user interface (OP Sepolia)](https://optimism-sepolia.easscan.org)
*   [JavaScript SDK](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/developer-tools/eas-sdk)
*   [Access directly onchain](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-contracts/blob/master/contracts/EAS.sol) (if you need to attest from a smart contract)

## Indexing

Indexing is available via:

*   [GraphQL endpoint](https://docs.attest.sh/docs/developer-tools/api)
*   [Ponder graph](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-ponder-graph)
*   [Open source indexer](https://github.com/ethereum-attestation-service/eas-indexing-service)
