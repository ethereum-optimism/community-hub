# Law of Chains Disclaimer

> **The [Law of Chains](https://gov.optimism.io/t/law-of-chains-v0-1-full-draft/6514) is fundamentally social in nature, intended to guide Optimism Governance and participants in the Optimism Collective. It is not a legal contract, and provides no legally enforceable warranties, representations, indemnities, rights, or obligations.  Participants commit to the Law of Chains independently.  No party acquires the ability to bind the other by virtue of their shared commitment to these guidelines.**


The Law of Chains is intended to provide guidance to ecosystem participants.  It does not establish any legally enforceable rights or obligations.  Its contents do not have the effect of law and are not meant to legally bind the public or any person in any way.  

For example, the Law of Chains presents a concept of “Participant Protections.”  This framing is intended to reflect elevated importance; a matter of principle. But Participant Protections are not, and do not create, legal rights, or corresponding legal obligations. They are not absolutely guaranteed to any ecosystem participant.  

If Participant Protections are violated, one may appeal to Optimism Governance.  This is like saying: “one may appeal to the democratic process.”  Optimism Governance is not a legal entity or a singular adjudicative body.  It is a collection of many unaffiliated, independent, and uncoordinated individual voters.  Its outcomes cannot be guaranteed. 

Relatedly, participants that subscribe to the Law of Chains do so independently, and they conduct themselves independently under it, bearing their own risks and rewards. No party acquires the ability to contractually bind the other by virtue of their shared commitment to these guidelines. The Law of Chains does not create a partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise, or agency relationship among anyone. 

The Law of Chains is a set of guidelines.  It is not a contract.  If you need legally enforceable guarantees from specific people or entities, you need some kind of specific contract with them. This document, standing alone, is not that.  For more information, see Law of Chains, Section 8 (Enforcement).
