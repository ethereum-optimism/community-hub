# Delegate Expectations

Thank you for joining as an active delegate in Optimism Token House Governance. 

As a delegate, you should:

- Join the conversation in the below channels in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/optimism):
  - [#gov-general](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/968498307913637919): This channel is for general governance discussions.
  - [#delegate-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/989611992295813241): If you are a Top 100 delegate, join the conversation with other larger delegates to discuss proposals & the governance process. You can check your ranking [here](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house)

- Provide feedback on draft proposals in the [Proposals Discussion](https://gov.optimism.io/c/technical-proposals/47) section of the Forum
     - If you are a Top 100 delegate then you can also approve non-grant proposals. You can check your ranking [here](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/optimism-op-token-house).
       Non-grant proposals need at least 4 approvals to move to a vote. 
       To approve a proposal post this phrase in a forum comment on Discourse:
       > **I am an Optimism delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.**

- Vote on non-grant proposals via the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/). 
  
- Post your voting rationale in a [Delegate Communications Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41)

- Join the community calls, which occur every other Tuesday at 1pm ET. 
  [The governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y180aHVpNzBpdG0wODllN3Q4cTUwaGVoMWtub0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) shows which Tuesdays, and how to join the call. You can also check which Season and Cycle we're in on the calendar.
