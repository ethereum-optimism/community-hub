# Additional Support

## Developer Support ðŸ™‹ðŸ’»

Steps to take if you would like developer support immediately, ranked in order of response times. 

1. Get help quickly in our [Developer Support repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions).
2. See our [Developer Documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/) & [Tutorials](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial).

## Tweeting

We do the occasional retweet but the bar for these is kept quite high in order to keep our Twitter feed as valuable/high signal as possible. 

Other than RT's, we may like or reply to a tweet or include it in our weekly wrap up thread.
