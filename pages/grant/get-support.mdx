# Additional Support

Welcome! If you have not filled out the connect with [Optimism form](https://share.hsforms.com/1yENj8CV9TzGYBASD0JC8_gqoshb) please do so prior to reading this.

We are excited for your deployment onto OP Mainnet!
You will be welcomed by [insightful metrics](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/Optimism), [a budding community](https://discord.gg/optimism) 🫂🫂, and some great exclusive [Telegram Channels](https://t.me/+Cb7q0a1YqItkZTRk) ⚙️⚙️ for builders.

## Developer Support 🙋💻

Steps to take if you would like developer support immediately, ranked in order of response times. 

1. Get help quickly in our [Developer Support repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions).
2. See our [Developer Documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/) & [Tutorials](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial).

## Marketing Requests 🦸🦸

When your project is deployed on the Superchain, you can be added to [our Superchain apps page](https://www.optimism.io/apps). Simply [fill out this form](https://share.hsforms.com/1hUEaGvsySTK9ccNBcNmjkwqoshb) to be included. Inclusion is at our discretion. 

### Promoting Values before anything else

We love to promote values-aligned projects as part of our broader content program.

### Tweeting

We do the occasional retweet but the bar for these is kept quite high in order to keep our Twitter feed as valuable/high signal as possible. 

Other than RT's, we may like or reply to a tweet or include it in our weekly wrap up thread. 
You're welcome to submit your tweet for amplification but please keep in mind if and how we interact with it is at our sole discretion.
