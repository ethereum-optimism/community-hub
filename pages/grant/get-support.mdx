Steps to take if you would like developer support immediately, ranked in order of response times.

1. See our [Developer Documentation](https://docs.optimism.io) & [Tutorials](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial).

## Marketing Requests 🦸🦸

When your project is deployed on the Superchain, you can be added to [Superchain Eco's Apps page](https://www.superchain.eco/projects).

### Promoting Values before anything else

We love to promote values-aligned projects as part of our broader content program.

### Tweeting

We do the occasional retweet but the bar for these is kept quite high in order to keep our Twitter feed as valuable/high signal as possible. 

Other than RT's, we may like or reply to a tweet or include it in our weekly wrap up thread. 
You're welcome to submit your tweet for amplification but please keep in mind if and how we interact with it is at our sole discretion.
