## Grants in the Optimism Collective

In Season 7, there is one singular Intent - a set of ***interoperable*** Stage 1 chains doing $250m per month in cross-chain asset transfers.

All contributions, and therefore all grants, in the Collective should be working towards this singular Intent in Season 7. You can learn more about the Season 7 Intent [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-7-intent/).

All grants in the Optimism Collective can be thought of as Missions, and there are three types of Missions:
- Foundation Missions
- Retro Funding Missions
- Governance Fund Missions

Missions are specific initiatives aimed at making measurable progress towards the Intent. They are clearly scoped, and can be executed by Collective contributors start-to-finish in less than 12 months.

## Measuring Impact of Missions

All Missions will work towards the same Intent. All impact will be measured, across the Collective, on the same, recurring measurement dates. Specific details about Retro Funding and other measurement mechanics will be provided throughout Season 7.
