# Local Optimists

Sharing is caring, and we know you want to share the Optimism Vision with your community! 

We have heard it again and again - you want to run events with your local community. Some of you have gone ahead and run the events! And we are so proud. 

We are developing a program to better support you in bringing your local community into the Optimism Collective. If you want to run an event now or want to be informed when this program goes live, please keep an eye on this page and in our Discord. 

[Sign up to be a part of the program](https://optimismfnd.typeform.com/local-optimists) (we will message you when the program goes live!)
