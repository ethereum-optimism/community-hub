# govNERDs Contribution Path

## What are govNERDs?

govNERDs are contributors to the Optimism Collective Governance with two primary goals:

1. **Reducing the Foundation's workload** in governance operations.
2. **Onboarding potential contributors and delegates** to the Collective.

## Responsibilities of govNERDs

govNERDs are responsible for:

- **Communication**: Announcing updates to Citizens and Delegates about proposals, voting cycles, and relevant information.
- **Mentorship**: Guiding and mentoring potential contributors in governance participation.
- **Moderation**: Overseeing the Governance Forum and Discord server, answering questions, and assisting projects or individuals.
- **Onboarding**: Helping new delegates get started and feel comfortable in their roles.
- **Support**: Assisting projects in applying for Retro Funding.

## Who Can Be a govNERD?

This is an open contribution path. Anyone interested in governance and willing to engage in community activities can join the govNERD Contribution Path if they meet the requirements outlined below.

## How to Start?

To begin your journey as a govNERD, follow these steps:

2. **Claim Your Role on Discord**: After [joining the Optimism Discord](https://discord.gg/optimism) server, claim your `wannabe-govNERD` role [here](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1262416527131410556/1262417034738798603). 
3. **Read All Governance Documents**: Familiarize yourself with [key governance documents](https://www.notion.so/govNERD-s-Hub-b62007191660423b993f13dc8cf3cfc0?pvs=21) like the Operating Manual, Code of Conduct, Rules of Engagement, and the Optimism Vision.
4. **Join Governance Calls**: Start participating in governance-related calls, such as grant council meetings and RetroFunding discussions, to deepen your involvement.
5. **Monitor Available Tasks**: Keep an eye on the [Notion board](https://www.notion.so/e6e73d8af8324622b41a426ad91a3d4e?pvs=21) for tasks that Maintainers request.
6. **Propose a Task**: If you want to propose a task, follow this [tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/90e38ac17ad5440baa3bf37bdef2db1f?sid=e11d5242-d60b-47bc-a718-4e0163854ced) provided to ensure it aligns with govNERD guidelines.

## govNERD Roles

The govNERD Contribution Path maintains a community of contributors with high governance context. Contributors can progress through four roles based on their understanding and engagement:

1. `wannabe-govNERDs`
2. `govNERDs-in-training`
3. `govNERDs`
4. `govNERDs-maintainers`

### Progression Between Roles

Contributors can move from one role to the next by meeting the following criteria:

1. **Duration**: They must have held their current role for at least 2 months to filter out bots and low-commitment contributors.
2. **Activity**: They must meet the contribution minimums for their role for two consecutive months.
3. **Availability**: The role they are progressing into must have space, such as available mentors for `govNERDs-in-training`.

*Note*: The list of available contributions is not exhaustive and may evolve with each season.

*Like all Contribution Path roles, these roles are intended for independent and engaged community members who volunteer to provide their knowledge and expertise to the Collective. These roles come without guaranteed rewards. These volunteers are not employees of the Collective, the Foundation, or any of its affiliates for any purposes.*
