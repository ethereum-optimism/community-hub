# SuperStacks 

## About

With many chains building as one, a new network structure is emerging to solve fragmentation in Ethereum. This network is modular, interoperable, and composable by default. We call it the Superchain: and it changes everything.

However, infrastructure alone is not enough. We need new ways to reward those who participate in this shared network. Systems that recognize contribution not to a single app or chain, but to the whole.

At Optimism, we believe in building for the long haul, and experimenting, iterating, and learning along the way. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re introducing *SuperStacks:* a pilot points program testing a more proactive and intentional approach to ecosystem rewards that moves beyond traditionally siloed incentives. 

SuperStacks aims to reward behavior around interoperable assets and applications that work seamlessly across multiple chains. The program is specifically designed to prepare the ecosystem for the upcoming interoperability launch by accelerating development of apps and use cases that will thrive in an interoperable Superchain. It will generate insights that help evolve this program into a long-term engine for ecosystem growth.

# FAQs

## Basic Questions

### When does SuperStacks begin and when does it end?

The program starts on the 16th of April 2025 @ 16:00 UTC, and ends on the 30th of June 2025 @ 11:59pm UTC. 

### When can I redeem my points?

After the program is completed the amount of OP tokens you can redeem for each XP will be announced, and the claims page will be published. More information about when claims will go live will be made available towards the end of the program. 
OP tokens left unclaimed after one year will be returned to the treasury and can no longer be claimed. The claims page will be linked to on the [SuperStacks Leaderboard](https://app.optimism.io/superstacks). 

### Which chains, protocols & pools are included?

The starting list of pools can be found on the [SuperStacks Leaderboard](https://app.optimism.io/superstacks). More chains, protocols and tokens may be added during the program, so keep an eye out for new pool announcements! 

### How is the XP calculated?

10 XP = $1 in liquidity for 24hrs

You will start to receive XP once your liquidity has been in a qualifying pool for 24hrs. For every $1 that remains in the qualifying pool for 24 consecutive hrs, you earn 10 XP, per pool.

Please ensure that the protocol you are using is the correct version (for example, Uniswap v3 vs Uniswap v4). If you are unsure if you have the correct pool you can follow the link to the pool directly from the [SuperStacks Leaderboard](https://app.optimism.io/superstacks). 
Note that the XP points are updated daily. There are also additional bonuses and multipliers that may apply to the pools you are in, resulting in a higher XP amount than the base rate above. These multipliers may change through the course of the program. 

### Why is there no weekly XP points emission rate? 

The emission rate cannot be fixed due to the way XP is earned ($1 to 10 XP per 24 hours). As such, the amount of XP allocated over the week depends on the activity and volume in the various pools. 

You can view the cumulative number of points on the [SuperStacks Leaderboard](https://app.optimism.io/superstacks), enabling you to manually track weekly emissions over time.

## XP Questions

### Where can I check how many points I have?

To check how many points you have see the leaderboard [SuperStacks Leaderboard](https://app.optimism.io/superstacks), or check with our [data provider](https://www.obl.dev/).

### How long does it take for me to get my points?

Your points should be updated after 24hrs. If your points have not been updated within 48 hours, please follow the points self check steps. 

## Meta Questions

### Why is Optimism doing a points program?

Optimism is testing the hypothesis that proactive (do something, get rewarded) points programs may have a stronger impact than retroactive (already done something, get rewarded) airdrop campaigns. 

SuperStacks is the result of extensive, industry-wide research, and this pilot program will give Optimism deep, valuable insights into whatâ€™s most effective. This points program is our first experiment with this kind of program, trying to get deeper liquidity on [Superchain Interop](https://docs.optimism.io/interop/explainer) ready assets. Learn more about [Superchain Interop](https://docs.optimism.io/interop/explainer). 

### Why are these incentives focused on stables?

Inline with the [Collective Intents for S7](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-7-intent/9292) of [Optimism Governance](https://community.optimism.io/welcome/welcome-overview), this program aims to experiment with point program incentives as a means of supporting Superchain TVL. All the assets incentivised are SuperchainERC20s, meaning they are ready for when [Superchain Interop](https://docs.optimism.io/interop/explainer) goes live. Learn more about [Superchain Interop](https://docs.optimism.io/interop/explainer).

### How many OP tokens are in the SuperStacks program?

Optimism is starting with a small, flexible amount of OP and a plan to scale it from there.
Optimism is introducing SuperStacks as a small pilot program to test the hypothesis that proactive points programs can have a stronger impact than retroactive airdrop campaigns. Optimism and its community are known for their openness to experimentation and iteration.

### Why is my smart wallet/Safe not getting points?

Only EOAs are indexed, so smart wallets and Gnosis Safes are not eligible for XP. 

## Bugs & Issues

### The leaderboard is not loading, how can I check my points?

Check your XP with our [data provider](https://www.obl.dev/) directly or on the [SuperStacks Leaderboard](https://app.optimism.io/superstacks).

### Points Self Check / Missing points

Think you should have gotten points but itâ€™s not reflecting on the leaderboard? Follow these steps:
1. Wait 24 hours, in case the points system is lagging.
2. Check with our [data provider](https://www.obl.dev/) directly. 
3. Check that the chain, protocol and the pool you are in is included in the program. Make sure you are using the correct version of the protocol (for example, Uniswap V3 vs Uniswap V4 may both have the pool, but only Uni V4 is incentivised).
4. Double check your tokens were in the pool for at least 24 hours consecutivly.
5. Still sure you should have points? Join our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/optimism) and head to the SuperStack channel. Share the transaction hash of your assets entering the pool with the SupNERDs in the channel, and they will double check everything for you, and escalate if needed. 

### Having trouble loading the leaderboard? Need help?

If you are having trouble with a protocol, have questions about which pools, chains or protocols are included or need more information, you can get help from a real person in our [Community Discord](https://discord.gg/optimism)!
