# Airdrop 3

Airdrop 3 took place on Monday, September 18. The airdrop allocated 19,411,313 OP to 31,870 unique addresses. 

Similar to Airdrop 2, this drop rewards positive sum governance participation. Users who have delegated tokens between 2023-01-20 at 0:00 UTC and 2023-07-20 0:00 UTC received tokens in this airdrop. A bonus is given to addresses who delegated to a delegate who voted in Optimism Governance. 

Read on for more detail about eligibility criteria and allocations.

> Airdrop #3 is disbursed directly to eligible wallets. There is no need to claim tokens by interacting with any website. Do not trust any website pretending to help you claim your tokens for Airdrop #3. If an address is eligible, it will have tokens sent directly to it on or shortly after Sep 15, 2023.

## Airdrop #3 Allocations

| Reward Type | Criteria | Number of qualifying addresses | Reward allocation
| - | -: | -: | -:
| Governance Delegation Reward | Delegated OP above the minimum threshold | 31,529 | 0.67 ⁄ 365 OP per `OP Delegated x Day`(1), max 10,000 OP per address
| Voting Delegate Bonus | Delegated to an address that voted onchain at least once (2) | 25,561 | (0.67 ⁄ 365)*2 OP per `OP Delegated x Day to a voting delegate`, max 10,000 OP per address

### Details

(1) `OP Delegated x Days` = Cumulative Sum of OP Delegated per Day (i.e. 20 OP delegated for 100 days: 20 * 100 = 2,000 OP Delegated x Days).

(2) Delegate must have voted onchain in OP Governance during the snapshot period (01-20-2023 at 0:00 UTC and 07-20-2023 0:00 UTC )

### Cutoff Criteria

- Addresses with fewer than 18,000 `OP Delegated x Days` (or 9,000 if delegated to a voting delegate) were not eligible for this airdrop.
- Addresses who were delegated for < 7 days were not eligible for this airdrop
- Known delegation program wallets were not eligible for this airdrop.
- Each reward type had a maximum reward of 10,000 OP per address.

*Note: A small set of delegation activity was not included in Airdrop #2. The eligible amounts were added to this allocation, resulting in 341 additional addresses.*

### How it works:

- To work out your `Cummultive Delegated OP`, multiply your OP delegated by the time delegated: `OP delegated x Days` = `Cummultive Delegated OP`. To qualify for the airdrop your `Cummultive Delegated OP` needs to be larger than 18,000. If you delegated to a “Voting Delegate” the `Cummultive Delegated OP` only needs to be above 9,000. For example, if you delegated 80 OP tokens for 180 days that would make a `Cummultive Delegated OP` of 14,400 which would NOT qualify for the airdrop. However, if the delegate you delegated to was active, then your 14,400 is above the 9,000 required for a voting delegate and you WOULD receive the airdrop.
    - Addresses who delegated for less than 7 days are not eligible.
    - Known delegation program wallets were not eligible for this airdrop.
    - Each reward type had a maximum reward of 10,000 OP per address.
- For the Voting Delegate Bonus the address you have delegated to MUST have voted onchain in OP Governance during the snapshot period (2023-01-20 at 0:00 UTC and 2023-07-20 0:00 UTC)
