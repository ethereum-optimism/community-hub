# What is the Social Contract?

The Social Contract is an **attestation layer** deployed on Optimism. It enables _anyone_ to make arbitrary attestations about other addresses. Anyone is able to read, add to, or build on top of this data primitive. When multiple entities participate in providing qualitative attestations about actors within a community, an invaluable data library is created for the broader ecosystem. You can view the source code for this data primitive here (to be added).
