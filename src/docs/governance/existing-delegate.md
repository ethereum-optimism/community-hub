Thank you for being active in Optimism Token House Governance. 

As a delegate, you should:

- Join the conversation in the below channels in our [Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/):
  - [#gov-general](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/968498307913637919): This channel is for general governance discussions.
  - [#grants](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/1069653708369047623): This channel is for discussion about the grants process and for delegates to provide feedback to grant applicants
  - [#delegate-discussion](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/989611992295813241): If you are a delegate with more than 0.25% delegated voting power, join the conversation with other larger delegates to discuss proposals & the governance process.

- Provide feedback on draft proposals in the [Proposals Discussion](https://gov.optimism.io/c/proposals/38) section of the Forum
     - If you have more than 0.25% of voting supply then you can also approve non-grant proposals.
       Non-grant proposals need at least 4 approvals to move to a vote. 
       To approve a proposal post this phrase in a forum comment on Discourse:
       > **I am an Optimism delegate with sufficient voting power and I believe this proposal is ready to move to a vote.**

- Vote on non-grant proposals via the [Optimism Governance Portal](https://vote.optimism.io/). 
  

- Post your voting rationale in a [Delegate Communications Thread](https://gov.optimism.io/c/governance/41)

- Join the community calls, which occur every other Tuesday at 1pm ET.
