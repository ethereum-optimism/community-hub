## Collective Grants

**Collective Grants** support specific projects to be completed in the future. All Collective Grants are made in OP and are locked for one year, except growth experiments grants which may pass OP directly through to the end-users. Collective Grants may be distributed upon completing the milestones specific to your grant application.

There are four different types of Collective Grants.  

### 1. Grants Council

The [Grants Council](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208) is a group of community members elected by the Token House. The council makes small to medium-sized grants based in two categories: 

- **Builders Grants:** To support builders innovating on novel applications and infrastructure
- **Growth Experiments Grants:** To support projects with strategies to drive more users on Optimism via novel incentive programs

Here are some examples of projects that received grants from the Grants Council in [Cycle 10](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-10-final-grants-roundup/5418) and [Cycle 11](https://gov.optimism.io/t/cycle-11-final-grants-roundup/5842). 

**How to apply:**

- The [Grants Council](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208) processes applications on five-week cycles during regular Voting Cycles.  You can reference the [governance calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r?cid=Y19mbm10Z3VoNm5vbzZxZ2JuaTJncGVyaWQ0a0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) for schedule and deadlines.
- Apply [here](https://app.charmverse.io/op-grants/page-701220845245208)! To understand the types of grants the Council would like to make, please see Requests for Grants (Coming soon!)

### 2. Token House **Missions**

Missions are specific pieces of work proposed by contributors. The Token House votes on approving Missions once per Season (roughly once every four-six months). 

[Mission](https://gov.optimism.io/t/token-house-missions/5881)s support a broader range of grants than the Grants Council. Any initiative that aligns with one of the [Collective Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874/2) can receive a grant! Missions should be specific initiatives that can be completed start-to-finish (marked done by the end of the Season). 

Here is a good [example](https://gov.optimism.io/t/superchain-governance-deep-dive/5920). 

**How to apply:** 

- You can apply by submitting a [Mission proposal](https://gov.optimism.io/t/proposed-mission-template/5882) on the forum requesting the grant amount that corresponds to your [Trust Tier](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-trust-tiers/5877).
- Mission Proposals will be approval ranked by the Token House every six months. Missions in Season 4 should be proposed on the Forum by June 21st and will be voted on by June 28th.
- Watch [How to Submit a Mission Proposal](https://www.loom.com/share/b99a39d0a1ec4dd1a75884f0b6c46a0b)

### 3. Foundation **Missions (RFPs)**

Foundation Missions are requests for contributors to build specific projects specified by the Optimism Foundation. Each Mission has a bounty of OP attached.

You can view the full list of Foundation Missions (RFPs) [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP). 

**How to apply:**

- Find an open Foundation Mission on the list that you’d like to work on.
- Submit your application by replying as a comment on the [RFP’s Github Issue.](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP)  Each Foundation Mission (RFPs) will specify a submission and selection deadline.
- Watch [How to Apply for an RFP](https://www.loom.com/share/c7f43e6ab8a44005969af46b7fd7a124)

### 4. The Partner Fund

The [Partner Fund](https://gov.optimism.io/t/partner-fund-overview/5268) is a grants program run by the Optimism Foundation. It’s focused on strategic or larger scale grants to partners that have already achieved product market fit. These grants are typically larger than those made by the Grants Council. 

**How to apply:**

- Apply [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+RFP)! There are no deadlines, applications are processed on a rolling basis.

# Retroactive Grants (RetroPGF)

RetroPGF stands for Retroactive Public Goods Funding. RetroPGF rewards are allocated by the Citizens’ House to reward work that has already been completed for its impact. 

If you’re working on something you believe is aligned with the Collective and you don’t need as much upfront certainty around scope of work, reward amount, or timing of rewards, you could be a good candidate for RetroPGF rewards.

- Decisions on which projects receive rewards are made by the Citizens’ House based on their assessment of each projects’ positive impact to the Collective.
- The last round of RetroPGF rewarded developer tooling, community programs, solo builders, educational work, client teams, and much more. For more detail on past recipients, see this [post](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI). The next Round will be announced shortly.

**How to apply**:

- Build something that provides positive impact to the Collective! It’s that simple.
- In advance of Round 3, Optimism will circulate a Project Signup for candidates to describe their work.
- Our [Ideas List](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues) details many contributions that we believe would be strong candidates for RetroPGF rewards. Please indicate your interest by commenting on the relevant GitHub issue.  There are no deadlines.
