## Overview

5.4% of the total initial token supply (231,928,234 OP) will be distributed to Optimism projects and communities via the Governance Fund.  
The goal of the Governance Fund is to empower the OP community to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. 
You can read more about the total allocation of OP in the [Allocations section](./allocations.md) of our [Governance docs](./README.md). 

The learn more about the purpose of the Governance Fund please read the [Governance Fund Charter](https://gov.optimism.io/t/governance-fund-charter/3944).  


## Phase 1

Phase 1 will distribute grants to projects in the Optimism ecosystem. 
You can see how Phase 1 grants have been distributed to date in [the Governance Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eaHOlWB34ij1KGsXdaNyTQg4tt1Pu2JurJsElBb6a8k/edit#gid=0). 

Any project on Optimism can [apply for a grant via the Optimism Grants Council](https://foul-porch-0eb.notion.site/Optimism-Grants-Council-090bb648d1854136b9630c608da7a8bc). 

When a project gets a proposal approved, they are still eligible to apply for further proposals. 
The Optimism Foundation recommends that projects distribute their initial allocation of tokens before requesting further tokens. 
Projects are also encouraged to reference data from the success of their initial distribution to strengthen their case in future proposals.


## Phase 0

Phase 0 was designed to reward existing projects that have driven growth of the Optimism ecosystem. 

The amount of funding for each project was determined by a set of on-chain metrics, calculated via a snapshot of the Optimism chain on April 1, 2022 at 12:00am UTC.
