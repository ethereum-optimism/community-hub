title: What is the Optimism Collective?
lang: en-US
---

The [Optimism Collective](https://app.optimism.io/announcement) is a band of companies, communities, and citizens working together to reward public goods and build a sustainable future for Ethereum.
    
Together we will dispel the myth that public goods cannot be profitable. 
Public goods (such as Optimism and Ethereum) often go underfunded when incentives aren't properly aligned, forcing many to make trade-offs between earning a profit and building for the common good.
We are bound by a mutually beneficial pact, [our vision](https://www.optimism.io/vision) can be summed up with the equation **Impact = Profit**.
    
### How can we achieve this?

The Optimism Collective will deploy a new model for rewarding those who create or sustain public goods. 
We shall use a [retroactive public goods funding model](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c), sustained by the revenue generated by Optimism (and eventually other collective members), to support projects and communities building for the common good. 

Most of our public goods funding is going to be retroactive because it is relatiely easy to agree on what *is* useful, and see who built it.
It is a lot harder to identify in advance what *will be* useful, and which team will do the best job of building it.
We exepct that the possibility of an eventual exit payment will encourage investors to fund initial development efforts until the usefulness is obvious, in the same way that the possibility of an eventual IPO or buy out by a larger company encourages investors to fund startups today.

[Read here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/economics/#value-from-public-goods-drives-demand-for-blockspace) to see how we expect the value proposal of the collective to be a positive feedback loop and reinforce itself.


### How is this going to be governed?

We will take [an experimental and agile approach to governance](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/r888e4B5iiNQi-3_mO26ixgv-plQ099XWgqEOv9iWKA) to relentlessly iterate until we form a system which can stand the test of time.
Initially we are using a new model of digital democratic governance that consists of two houses: the *Token House* and the *Citizens' House*. 
    

## Token House

Governance of the Optimism Collective has begun with the launch of OP and the Token House. 
OP was distributed to hundreds of thousands of addresses that have engaged in positive-sum, community-oriented behavior with [Airdrop #1](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/). 
You can read more about the [distribution criteria here](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/airdrop-1/#). 
The Token House is governed by its members, OP token holders, which are now able to vote on the distribution of project incentives from the Governance Fund. 
Members of the Token House will also be able to vote on protocol upgrades and more in the future.

As Token House members, OP holders are responsible for submitting, deliberating, and voting on various types of governance proposals. 
In carrying out these functions, OP holders may either vote directly, or [delegate their OP voting power to an eligible third party](delegate.md).


- The Token House will vote on a variety of proposals types and has begun voting on the deployment of the Collective’s [Governance Fund](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/gov-fund/). The Governance Fund will distribute 5.4% of the OP token supply via grants aimed at empowering the OP community to proactively incentivize future growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem.
- The purpose of the Governance Fund is to incentivize sustainable growth of projects and communities in the Optimism ecosystem. This does not mean that all grants must be incentive programs. The Token House is welcome to consider any and all proposals which would drive growth or address a gap in the Optimism ecosystem, including public goods projects.
    
    However, funding should come with an expectation of growth-related deliverables. It is not the intended purpose of the governance fund to retroactively fund public goods without an expectation of future work—there is a distinct OP allocation dedicated to this, which will be distributed via the Citizens House at a later date.  
    
- The Token House may also vote on the below proposal types:
    - Governance Fund (Phase 1 grants)
    - Protocol Upgrade
    - Inflation Adjustment
    - Director Removal
    - Treasury Appropriations
    - Rights Protections

### 🏞️ What is the [Citizens’ House](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/#how-is-optimism-governed)?

- The Citizens House will be a large-scale experiment in non-plutocratic governance and retroactive funding of public goods. Citizenship will be conferred by “**[soulbound](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)**” non-transferrable NFTs, and the set of Citizens will grow over time. The exact mechanism for distributing Citizenships will be determined by the Foundation with input from the Token House.

    Read [Beyond Coin Voting](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/08/16/voting3.html) to learn about non-plutocratic governance  
    
- When launched, the Citizens House will be governed by a select group of OP Citizens, who are responsible for overseeing retroactive public goods funding (retroPGF). 20% of the OP supply is dedicated to retroPGF. retroPGF will also be funded via the productive re-deployment of sequencer revenue generated on Optimism.

- If you want to contribute to retroPGF, you can send ETH, ERC-20 tokens, or NFTs to the ENS address **retroPGF.eth**. It is supported on [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x15dda60616ffca20371ed1659dbb78e888f65556) as well as [Ethereum mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x15dda60616ffca20371ed1659dbb78e888f65556). Anything donated will be allocated to the next RetroPFG round. These funds do not go to OP Labs or the Optimism Foundation. The Foundation will help distribute funds according to the Citizens’ House governance process.



<!--

The Optimism Collective is a large-scale experiment in decentralized governance. 
Our [Vision](https://optimism.io/vision) is to sustainably fund public goods that improve upon the well-being of the Collective and beyond.

The form and function of this governance is intentionally open-ended, and will evolve with community participation, growth, and learning. 

Certain governance rights are granted via OP, an ERC20 token. 
The Optimism Foundation will work alongside the Collective to shape how the rules of governance evolve over time.

Today we plant a seed. 
Together we cultivate its growth towards a healthy and resilient commons. 

## How is Optimism governed?

Optimism is governed by a collaboration between the **Optimism Foundation** and the members of the **Optimism Collective**. 

The core governing structure of the Optimism Collective is established as two co-equal chambers: the **Token House** and the **Citizens’ House**. 
These two houses are tasked with balancing short-term incentives with long-term vision in the pursuit of the [Optimistic Vision](https://optimism.io/vision).

![Venn diagram](../../assets/docs/governance/readme/houses.jpeg)

The upcoming Airdrop #1 establishes the **Token House** by distributing OP to thousands of addresses that have engaged in positive-sum, community-oriented behavior. 
Token holders will be able to vote on the distribution of project incentives as a part of a Governance Fund, protocol upgrades, and more.

Next, the Collective will establish a **Citizens’ House** to facilitate and govern a process to distribute retroactive public goods funding. 
Citizenship will be conferred by “[soulbound](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html)” non-transferrable NFTs, and the set of citizens will grow over time. 
The mechanism for distributing Citizenships will be determined by the Foundation with input from the Token House. 

What is described here is an initial experiment. 
The specifics of this system will evolve as the Collective grows.

For more information on governance, see the [Working Constitution](https://gov.optimism.io/t/the-optimism-constitution/55/1).

## How is OP distributed?

**19% of initial OP token supply is reserved for user airdrops**. 
5% of initial supply will be distributed in Airdrop #1, and 14% will be distributed in future drops. 
We’re just getting started!

**25% of initial OP token supply is allocated for Proactive Project Funding**. 
This will be distributed via community governance, KPI-driven incentives, grants programs, and other mechanisms. 

**20% of initial OP token supply plus inflation is allocated for Retroactive Public Goods Funding.** 
The mechanics of this distribution will be an area of ongoing experimentation. 

**19% of initial OP token supply is allocated to core contributors.**

**17% of initial OP token supply is allocated to OP sugar xaddies** (aka investors).

For a full breakdown of OP distribution, see the [Allocations Overview](allocations.md).

## How does public goods funding fit in?

Today, the Optimism network generates millions in revenue from the small fees users pay to submit transactions. 
In the future, this income will be supplemented by auctioning off blockspace to non-malicious sequencers.

Instead of all that value being captured by private actors, Optimism treats it as a source of funding for public goods that support the ecosystem.

This provides **ongoing** funding for public goods beyond the portion of initial token supply allocated as such. 

These funds will initially be distributed in keeping with Optimism’s previous rounds of [Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c).
The Citizens’ House (described above) will be responsible for determining the allocation of these funds.

For details on the dynamics of OP and RetroPGF, see the [Economics Overview](economics.md).
