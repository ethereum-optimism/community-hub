## Where should I start?

If you're brand new to Optimism, we recommend checking out the [guide to deploying a basic contract](../developers/build/basic-contract.md) using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org).
It'll get you familiar with the core steps required to get a contract deployed to the network.
Luckily, Optimism is [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), so it's 100% the same as deploying a contract to Ethereum.

If you're a bit more familiar with Optimism and Ethereum, you can try walking through one of the various [tutorials](../developers/tutorials.md) put together by the Optimism community.
They'll help you get a headstart when building your first Optimistic project.


## Guides

These guides provide integration guidelines for specific topics.
They are intended as one stop shops, and should have all the relevant information you need for completing a specific type of integration, from network information and tutorials to tips and tricks.

We're aiming to maintain guides for many of the common interactions that developers might have with Optimism.
For example, we have guides for adding Optimism support to a [wallet](./wallet-dev.md) or a [CEX](./cex-dev.md).
We also have guides for getting your [token onto the standard bridge](./token-dev.md) or even [writing your own custom bridge](./bridge-dev.md).

Take a look at the list on the left for a complete list of the guides we've created so far.

### Want a specific guide added?

We'd love to hear from you in a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues) or on [Discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io).
