## [@eth-optimism/hardhat-ovm](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/packages/hardhat-ovm)

A `Node.js` package that contains various useful plugins for developing contracts to be deployed on Optimistic Ethereum.
Particularly useful for its support of the custom OVM Solidity compiler.

---
## [@eth-optimism/contracts](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/packages/contracts)
  
The various smart contracts that make up the L1 component of Optimistic Ethereum.
Useful if you're interested in understanding how an Optimistic Rollup works!

---
## [optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/ops)

A single GitHub repository intended to provide the ability to run a local Optimistic Ethereum environment including both L1 & L2 chains.
This can be used to rapidly iterate over the many Optimism repositories and run integration tests.
Optimism uses this pretty heavily during development.

## [@eth-optimism/smock](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/packages/smock) 
  
Smock is a hardhat plugin that allows you to mock the functionality of any smart contract with just a little bit of JavaScript.
Smock's [README on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/master/packages/smock/README.md) has thorough documentation.
You can even find a [community example of using Smock](https://soliditydeveloper.com/smock) written by [Markus Waas](https://soliditydeveloper.com/markuswaas/).
