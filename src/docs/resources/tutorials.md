## [*The "Official" Optimistic Ethereum Tutorial*](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/blob/main/README.md)

* By: [Optimism PBC](https://optimism.io)

The "official" introductory tutorial by the Optimism team.
Note, that this tutorial is _short and sweet_.
For more thorough guides, please refer to other the resources below or to the Protocol/Developer Docs (on the sidebar).

The "official" _Truffle_ tutorial made by the Optimism team.
This tutorial is shorter than the main tutorial above, but will still walk through the basics of compiling, testing, and deploying your contracts for Optimistic Ethereum using Truffle.

## [*scaffold-eth Optimistic NFTs*](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/tree/optimistic-nfts)

Made by the team at [`scaffold-eth`](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth).
Note that `optimistic-nfts` uses our old `optimism-integration` repository to create a local L1 and L2 geth node, but the project is still worth checking out to learn the general implementation details about how to create NFTs on Optimistic Ethereum!

* By: [Austin Griffith](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/commits?author=austintgriffith) and [Adam Fuller](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/commits?author=azf20)

* By: [ScopeLift](https://www.scopelift.co/)

A wonderful in-depth guide to porting a complex set of contracts (a la Uniswap) to Optimistic Ethereum.
Surprisingly painless!
