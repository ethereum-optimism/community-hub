Welcome to the OP Mainnet developer tools!

If you are already familiar with [building on OP Mainnet](../developers/README.md) and just need the tools to get cracking, you are in the right place!

## Connecting

You have the list of [networks](./networks.md) and [node providers](./providers.md) to help you connect to an Optimism node.

## Deploying

To get some ETH bridged over for deployment gas fees, use one of the available [faucets](./faucets.md) or just bridge ETH using the [OP Mainnet Gateway](https://gateway.optimism.io/).

## Monitoring

Your app is live in production? Watch it grow using one of the [monitoring tools](./monitoring.md). We also have a set of [troubleshooting tools](./debugging.md) and [block explorers](./explorers.md) to help you provide a stellar service to your users.

Other popular developer tools can be found [here](https://www.alchemy.com/ecosystem/optimism).
