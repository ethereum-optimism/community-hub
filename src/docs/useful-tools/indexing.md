Blockchain data is not query-able by default. Indexing tools help with extracting data from blockchain node, transforming it in a way that is understandable by human or computers, and loading it to a database or any other destination for querying.

## Flair

[Flair](https://flair.dev) is a real-time and historical custom data indexing for any evm chain.

It offers reusable **indexing primitives** (such as fault-tolerant RPC ingestors, custom processors and aggregations, re-org aware database integrations) to make it easy to receive, transform, store and access your on-chain data.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.flair.dev) or clone the [starter boilerplate](https://github.com/flair-sdk/starter-boilerplate) template and follow the instructions.
