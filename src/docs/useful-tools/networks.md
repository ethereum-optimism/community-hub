::: tip Developer Tip
We recommend using [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism) for its scalability, reliability, and data accuracy. 
:::

::: warning
Some API calls, such as those in the [personal namespace](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-personal) make no sense in a shared environment.
Such RPCs are either totally unsupported, or will return nonsensical values.

## Optimism (mainnet)


::: tip Pre-Bedrock
We are currently testing the [Bedrock](../developers/bedrock/bedrock.md) release.
The mainnet network has still not been updated.
:::


| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Network Name | **`Optimism`** |
| Description | **`Mainnet`** |
| Chain ID | **`10`** |
| Explorer | **[https://explorer.optimism.io](https://explorer.optimism.io)** |
| HTTP Endpoint<sup>1</sup> | We recommend [Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/optimism-api-quickstart/?a=818c11a8da). Optimism also provides this endpoint: **`https://mainnet.optimism.io`.** _But it is not for production systems and is rate limited._   |
| L1 Contract Addresses | [link](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments/mainnet#layer-1-contracts) |
| L2 Contract Addresses | [link](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments/mainnet#layer-2-contracts) |
| chainid.link | [https://chainid.link/?network=optimism](https://chainid.link/?network=optimism)

::: tip Developer Tip 
If you are seeing rate limit issues when testing with the public end point, or if you need websocket functionality, we recommend signing up for [Alchemy's](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism) free trial.

(1) Some API calls, such as those in the [personal namespace](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-personal) make no sense in a shared environment.
Such RPCs are either not supported, or will return nonsensical values.


### API Options:

1. Get free access to Optimism through [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism)

2. For small scale tests, you can use our public API:
- HTTP endpoint: [https://mainnet.optimism.io](https://mainnet.optimism.io) (note, this is for testing. For production, use Alchemy) 

You can run a large application for free using [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism). We’ve done extensive diligence and Alchemy is our recommendation due to reliability, scalability, and data correctness. They're the default API provider and developer platform for top projects like OpenSea and Facebook. 

## Optimism Goerli

::: tip Purpose
This is our test network.
It has already been updated to the [Bedrock](../developers/bedrock/bedrock.md) release.

They also support websocket functionality, which our public endpoint does not.

### Test ETH

[The Optimism Faucet](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/) provides Optimism Goerli ETH.
Alternatively, if you already have Goerli ETH, you can [bridge it](https://app.optimism.io/bridge). For more faucet options see [Network Faucets](./faucets.md).



::: warning Ignore other networks

Optimism mainnet and Optimism Goerli are, from Optimism's perspective, production networks. This means our Goerli network is something you can rely on for consistent state and uptime. We have other testnets that we use to test our code (such as the Goerli Nightly network) that we use to test new features. These networks are for _us_ to test, and therefore might not have reliable state & uptime. 

If you want to test out our new infrastructure before it is stable, or are interested in working on the latest and greatest protocols please check these networks out! If not, they are best ignored. 
We try to make sure they work and preserve the state.
In the months prior to a major release, such as Bedrock, we may have a different network for testing dapps on that release.

However, we also have other networks such as [Goerli Nightly](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments/goerli-nightly).
These are networks that are used for internal Optimism development.
Unless you are working on the Optimism protocol (rather than building things on top of it), ignore these networks.
