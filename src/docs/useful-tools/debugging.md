::: tip EVM Equivalence
As OP Mainnet is [EVM Equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), most debugging tools work out of the box with OP Mainnet.

## Tenderly

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) lets you [inspect any transaction execution on OP Mainnet or OP Goerli](https://docs.tenderly.co/debugger/how-to-use-tenderly-debugger). 
You can inspect the state of your verified contract in any step of the transaction's execution, as well as step into or over function calls. 
The level of detail the Tenderly dashboard presents will reduce your development time as well as help you understand the execution flow of transactions. 
It helps you to inspect states at every instance of transaction and gives a platform to trace transactions.


## Etherscan

[Etherscan](https://explorer.optimism.io) allows you to see events as well as revert messages for transactions that have been mined on OP Mainnet as well as [OP Goerli](https://goerli-explorer.optimism.io). 
You can see more information about all the L2 features Etherscan offers on our [Explorers page](./explorers.md#etherscan).


## Blockscout

Blockscout allows you to see events on both [OP Mainnet](https://optimism.blockscout.com) and [OP Goerli](https://optimism-goerli.blockscout.com).
