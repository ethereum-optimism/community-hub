::: tip EVM Equivalence
As Optimism is [EVM Equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), most debugging tools work out the box with Optimism.

## Tenderly 

[Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/) lets you inspect any transaction execution, both for Optimism (mainnet) and Optimism Kovan (testnet). You can inspect the state of your verified contract in any step of the transactions execution, as well as step into or over function calls. 

## Etherscan 

[Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io) allows you to see events as well as revert messages for transactions that have been mind on Optimism (mainnet) as well as Optimism Kovan (testnet). You can see more information about all the L2 features Etherscan offers in our [Explorers page](./explorers.md).
