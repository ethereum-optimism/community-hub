Acount Abstraction enables users to utilize smart contracts as their accounts. While the default account for most users today is an Externally Owned Account (EOA), smart account adoption has been growing due to their ability to create superior user experiences.

Did you know deploying a contract wallet on the OP Stack costs [34x less](https://dune.com/optimismfnd/How-Much-Could-You-Save-on-Optimism-Fee-Savings-Calculator?Transaction+Hash=0x6c097cd57b2f38236ecf06142185345be9263a8305d9b7afe559ee0d6830b640&Transaction+Block+Number=17190737&Transaction+Block+Number_nb9363=17678963&Transaction+Hash_t09de3=0xa37f0b5cdbcb0c26268bab2f3b37687851a1161a6d363c13d13872e2deb89b49) than Ethereum Mainnet?

## Why account abstraction?
Account abstraction (and contract accounts) enables more opportunities for dapps and wallet developers to innovate on user experiences including the ability to:

- Batch transactions together (e.g. approve and execute a swap in one go)
- Offer wallets with easy recovery and no seed phrase
- Sponsor the gas fees for transactions
- Enable users to pay gas in the token(s) of their choice
