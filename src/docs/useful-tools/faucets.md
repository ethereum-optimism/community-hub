## Testnet Faucets
Testnet faucets are services that distribute testnet ETH on test networks like OP Goerli and Ethereum Goerli for development and testing purposes.

#### Superchain Faucet
[Superchain Faucet](https://app.optimism.io/faucet) is a developer tool that allows you to claim free testnet Ether (ETH) to test apps on testnet OP Chains like OP Goerli. Testnet faucets for other OP Chains, such as Base Goerli, will be added soon!

#### Paradigm MultiFaucet

[Paradigm's MultiFaucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) is an easy way to get ETH on many different testnets at the same time.
One of those networks is OP Goerli.

#### Coinbase

Users of [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) can get test ETH on OP Goerli directly from the Coinbase Wallet extension or via the [Coinbase Faucet website](https://coinbase.com/faucets/optimism-goerli-faucet).

#### QuickNode

[Optimism Faucet for Goerli by QuickNode](https://faucet.quicknode.com/optimism/goerli) is another easy way to acquire
some testnet ETH for OP Goerli.

### Bridging testnet tokens to/from Ethereum L1
Need another option? Alternatively you can get L1 Goerli ETH from Alchemy's faucet [here](https://goerlifaucet.com/?a=818c11a8da) or similar Ethereum testnet faucets and use the [Optimism Bridge interface](https://app.optimism.io/bridge) to bridge the testnet ETH to OP Goerli.


## Mainnet Faucets

If you need to get ETH on OP Mainnet for a contract deployment, you can [bridge ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to OP Mainnet](https://app.optimism.io/bridge). This process takes about ~1 minute to complete.

You can also get some ETH for expenses by [bridging enough USDC](https://optifaucet.com/) courtesy of [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/).
