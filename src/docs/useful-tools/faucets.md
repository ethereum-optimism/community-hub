## Testnet Faucets

Each of these faucets can be used to get testnet funds on Optimism Kovan. 
If one of them does not work, please try another one. 
If you need more help, head over to **#dev-support** [on our Discord](https://discord--gateway.optimism.io).

Once you have the test ETH on Goerli, send it to [0x636Af16bf2f682dD3109e60102b8E1A089FedAa8](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x636Af16bf2f682dD3109e60102b8E1A089FedAa8), you will get it on Optimism Goerli.

#### Perpetual Protocol Testnet Faucet

[Optifaucet](https://kovan.optifaucet.com/) gives you a small amount of ETH, and 10,000 USDC. 
They do this because you need USDC to [use their application](https://testnet.perp.exchange/).

#### Optimism Kovan Faucet

[Optimism Faucet](https://optimismfaucet.xyz/) is a simple faucet for Optimism Kovan that drips ETH and DAI. Authenticate with github, enter your wallet address and you'll aumatically be sent 1 ETH and 100 DAI on the Optimism Kovan testnet.


## Mainnet Faucets

If you need to get ETH on mainnet for a contract deployment, you should [bridge ETH onto L2](https://gateway.optimism.io/).
This process is relatively cheap and takes about 20 minutes to complete.

You can also get some ETH for expenses by [bridging enough USDC](https://optifaucet.com/) courtesy of [Perpetual Protocol](https://perp.com/).
