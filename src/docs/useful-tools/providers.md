::: warning
Some API calls, such as those in the [personal namespace](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/rpc/ns-personal) make no sense in a shared environment.
Such RPCs are either totally unsupported, or will return nonsensical values.
:::

::: tip

**We strongly recommend all developers use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/optimism).** 
**We’ve done extensive diligence and Alchemy powers our public API.** 

We recommend Alchemy due to (a) the reliability, scalability and data correctness of its developer platform and (b) the comprehensive set of tooling and APIs they provide. You can run large applications on their massive free tier.
