::: tip Welcome!

So you want to get involved in the Optimism Collective?? We are so happy to have you! Let’s make sure we are on the same page about what The Collective is all about.

:::

The Optimism Collective believes that **building public goods should be rewarded.**

This key ingredient to the [Optimistic vision](https://www.optimism.io/vision) is more than just altruism – it’s core to our success. Optimism’s codebase itself is an open-source project, and builds on the shoulders of countless OSS giants which came before it.

This means public goods funding is a critical growth strategy. For Optimism, well-funded public goods means better developer tooling, widespread user education, safer infrastructure, and industry-leading research. It means Optimism can last and thrive.

Once we show that this model can drive a successful economy for the Optimism Collective, we can scale the principle of **`impact = profit`** to the world!

RetroPGF is a core part of Optimism’s vision. If done right, it will form the backbone for a new type of economy. As with any complex system, though, this new process can’t be centrally planned or designed all at once. **The only way to build it *well* is to build it *together*.** This journey will require care, open-mindedness, patience, and, of course, optimism!

So, how can you have meaningful impact in The Collective? We recommend following these 3 very easy principles:

1. ***Do what you love.*** → Real impact stems from passion, a love for what you do.
2. ***Fix the problem in front of you, together.*** → Chances are if you have a problem, someone else has that problem as well. Let’s fix it together! What caused the problem? How do you fix it, and can we work together to fix it for everyone else? 
3. ***Do it with optimism.*** → Be kind, patient and optimistic in everything you do. 

Most importantly, make sure that your contributions align with the [Collective Intents](https://gov.optimism.io/t/collective-intents/5874). This will help ensure that your contribution is working towards a larger goal of the Collective. 

# Getting Started

You can contribute towards the collective in a million different ways, and there is no way we could make processes for all of these contributions. Nor would we want to! However, getting from 0 to 1 is the hardest step. So we have made a few ways to get you up to speed and contributing in no time!
