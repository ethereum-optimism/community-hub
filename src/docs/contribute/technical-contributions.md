## Code contributions

The Optimism codebase is maintained in a monorepo at [https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism). It's a [collection of packages](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism#directory-structure) all requiring different skills to maintain and evolve ranging from NodeJS and TypeScript, Solidity and EVM, Go and Geth to Docker and Kubernetes. The following are good entry points into using your coding skills to help us build Optimism:

- Reporting issues. For security issues see [Security policy](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
- Participate in the [Bug Bounty programme](https://immunefi.com/bounty/optimism/).
- Fixing and responding to existing issues. You can start off with those tagged ["good first issue"](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/contribute) which are meant as introductory issues for external contributors.
  Contributions are rewarded with a cool [GitPOAP](https://www.gitpoap.io/gp/1035).
- Work on open [bounties on Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/ethereum-optimism).
