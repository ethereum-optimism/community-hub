At Optimism, we know that we can never truly decentralise if we do not embrace the diversity of our community. As such, we take translations seriously. 

If you can speak a second language and want to contribute to the collective, please do! 

You can [help translate our User Docs](https://crowdin.com/project/optimism-help-center) to your local langauge. We use [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/optimism-help-center) (you will need to make an account, but its free!).

CrowdIn translators for the Optimism Collective have previously [received RetroPGF](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/Upn_LtV2-3SviXgX_PE_LyA7YI00jQyoM1yf55ltvvI)! Find out more [about RetroPGF here](../../governance/citizens-house.md).
