# What are GovNERDs, and why do we need them?

Given the seasonal iterations of governance systems & processes, it is important to have new context, updates and schedules accurately shared. The GovNERD Contribution Path is focused on this specific problem space - navigating governance.

GovNERDs focus on:

- Supporting new or existing projects/individuals seeking grants/info or information about Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro Funding).
- Help onboard new delegates with getting started.
- Keeping existing delegates and citizens up to date.

They also maintain some related governance documentation & metrics.

## GovNERDs Contributions

The GovNERD Contribution Path is designed to maintain a community of contributors with high context in governance. The scope of tasks is broken down by each role within the path, based on contextual understanding. Contributors can progress through roles if they meet the criteria specified in each role. The 4 roles are:

1. `wannabe-govNERDs`
2. `govNERDs-in-training`
3. `govNERDs`
4. `govNERDs-maintainers`

### Progression Between Roles

Contributors are able to move from one role to the next so long as the following criteria is met:

1. They have been in the previous role for at least 2 months. This helps filter out bots and lower commitment contributors. 
2. They need to meet contribution minimums for their role for 2 consecutive months.
3. The role they are moving into has space for them. For example, `in-training` contributors have mentors available to them, so a ratio of mentors to mentees needs to be maintained. `GovNERDs` get contributed through Mission proposals, however there are not unlimited positions available. 

NOTE: The list of available contributions below is not exhaustive, and may change as the season progresses. The available tasks mentioned below are meant to give an idea and general scope for each role.

*Like all Contribution Path roles, the GovNERD roles described here are intended for independent and engaged community members who volunteer to provide their knowledge and expertise to the Collective. These roles come without guaranteed rewards. These volunteers are not employees of the Collective, the Foundation, or any of its affiliates for any purposes.*

# GovNERD Roles

## `wannabe-govNERDs`

### Required Context

- Read through governing documents - OPerating manual, Code of Conduct, Rules of Engagement, the Optimism Vision, the governance docs website, RetroFunding, etc.
- Join calls - joining grant council calls, RetroFunding calls, governance calls, etc.
- Keep up with discussions - Read through the governance forum regularly, engage in governance channels on Discord and Telegram.

### Available Contributions

- Data collection - Helping GovNERD maintainers collect data (delegate proposal endorsements, etc).
- Data validation - Checking delegate approvals are from valid delegates, double checking grant amounts on trackers, etc. Generally verifying data collected by other roles in the path.

### Activity Minimums

- At least 1 hour of activity per week in the gov forum.
- Completing at least one available contribution per voting cycle.
- Join at least one community call per month.
- Join or async participate in govNERDs calls.

### Progress Criteria

In order to progress to a `GovNERDs-in-training` you will need to meet the following criteria:

- Been a `wannabe-govNERD` for at least 2 months.
- Met the `wannabe-govNERD` activity minimums for at least 2 months.
- Have a comprehensive understanding of how Optimism governance works (what is a season, a cycle, where does voting happen, who votes on what, etc).
- Have a basic understanding of grants and RetroFunding (what grants are available? Where can people go to get them? What is RetroFunding? Where and when can people apply for RetroFunding? etc).
- Available mentor - while this is not a requirement the `wannabe-govNERD` can fulfil themselves, it is essential that the path can successfully accomidate a new contributor in training.

## `govNERDs-in-training`

### Required Context

- All context from the `wannabe-govNERDs` role.
- Deepening understanding of how grants work, where people can apply, RetroFunding and associated applications and scope.
- Deeply understanding proposal life cycles, templates, and proposal types.
- If specialising, going into the history of that specialty, previous changes and reasoning.

### Available Contributions 

- `GovNERDs-in-training` are able to complete GovNERD tasks (with the exception of public facing tasks such as assisting delegates with proposals). `GovNERDs-in-training` need their mentor to sign off on any contributions (they will assist in quality assurance, fact checking, and generally ensuring the contributions are in line with govNERD expectations).

### Activity Minimums

- At least 2 hour of activity per week in the gov forum.
- Completing at least two available contribution per voting cycle.
- Join at least one community call per month.
- Join or async participate in govNERDs calls.

### Progress Criteria

In order for a `govNERD-in-training` to progress the following criteria need to be met:
- Active as a `govNERD-in-training` for at least 2 months.
- A nomination from an existing `govNERD`.

Once contributors have the `govNERDs-in-training` role they may choose to specialise into one of the Governance Houses (Token or Citizen) or Grants Council to provide even deeper specialised support.

## `govNERDs`

### Required Context

- All context from previous roles.
- Maintaining context - it is essential for GovNERDs to maintain context on the governance forum, and with new governance developments.
- Community feedback - GovNERDs should keep note of community feedback on any and all governance processes, and relay this information back to the team during govNERD calls.
- Deep understanding of Grants Council operations, Token House Seasons & Delegates, and Retro Funding Rounds & Citizens.

### Available Contributions

- Attend community calls.
- Onboard new delegates and governance participants.
- Data collection - Verifying delegate endorsements, calculating reward distributions (based on established criteria), etc. This is a exhaustive list.
- Ensure proposals are up to standard - ensuring that proposals follow the templates, reminding delegates to give feedback on proposals, etc.
- Ensure delegates understand what is going on, changes between seasons and new processes.
    - Answer Discord questions from Delegates.
- Escalation - GovNERDs have direct access to the Optimism Governance team to flag potential issues, feedback and misunderstandings.
- Mentoring new `govNERDs-in-training`.
- Flagging and reporting inappropriate or irrelevant content in the gov forum. More guidelines for what is considered inappropriate will be provided later.

### Activity Minimums 

- Completing at least three available contribution per voting cycle.

- Join or async participate in govNERDs calls.
- (when available) mentor new `govNERDs-in-training`.

## `govNERD-maintainers`

### Required Context

- All context from previous roles.
- Additionally to previous roles, maintainers may also get access to new iterations of governance processes early. These new processes need to be understood so the maintainers can inform other govNERDs as well as delegates in the reflection period.

### Available Contributions

- All contributions from GovNERDs are required for this role.
- Forum maintenance - Maintainers are given moderation rights in the gov forum and are expected to monitor, manage, and reduce low quality forum engagement.
- Proposal voting - manage announcements and reminders to delegates.
- Proposal creation - maintainers are able to create drafts for “Voting Cycles” (verified by the Optimism gov team and other GovNERDs).
- Calendar management - Maintainers are able to manage and maintain the governance calendar.
- Data verification - Verifying data collected by other govNERD roles.
- Nominate talented `wannabe-govNERDs` to `GovNERDs-in-training`. By default nominators are the mentor.

### Activity Minimums

- Activity minimums are the same as regular `govNERDs` with the following added responsibilities:
    - Ensure that `govNERDs` have mentees.
    - Checking in with new `govNERDs` and `govNERDs-in-training` both in terms of their contributions (quality & quantity) and their experience and enjoyment of being a part of the `govNERDs`.
    - A more strict definition of activity for `govNERD-maintainers` will be developed over S6.
