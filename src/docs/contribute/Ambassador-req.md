### Content Submission Guidelines:

- **NO PRICE DISCUSSION,** EVER!! This includes speculating about price, moon references, etc. This applies for all projects and not just the OP token. Focus on impact, not profit. 
- Content can be written, audio, video, or a mix and may be on any platform. If you are an artist, then create a visual artefact to demonstrate your understanding of the subject matter.
- Content thoroughly explains the subject and makes a deeper connection to Optimism’s values and or has connected it to Optimism’s larger vision.
- Content is accurate
- Content can be as long or as short as you would like, provided you demonstrate an understanding of the subject matter and put some effort in!
- Hint: Every single prompt is connected in one or many ways to every other prompt. When you start to make those connections, you begin to realize just how grand of a vision Optimism has and why Optimism’s Ambassadors are the best of the best.

**NOTE:**

To submit non-English content there must be 2 translators available in that language to review submission.
