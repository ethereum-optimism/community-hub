title: Running a local development environment
lang: en-US
---

## What is this?

A development environment is a local installation of the entire Optimism system.
Our default development environment includes both L1 and L2 development nodes.
Running the Optimism environment locally is a great way to test your code and see how your contracts will behave on Optimism before you graduate to a testnet deployment (and eventually a mainnet deployment).

Alternatively, you can get a hosted development node from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/layer2/optimism) or [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/chains/optimism). 


## Do I need this?

We generally recommend using the local development environment if your application falls into one of the following categories:

1. **You're building contracts on both Optimism and Ethereum that need to interact with one another.** The local development environment is a great way to quickly test interactions between L1 and L2. The Optimism testnet and mainnet environments both have a communication delay between L1 and L2 that can make testing slow during the early stages of development.

2. **You're building an application that might be subject to one of the few [differences between Ethereum and Optimism](./differences.md).** Although Optimism is [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), it's not exactly the same as Ethereum. If you're building an application that might be subject to one of these differences, you should use the local development environment to double check that everything is running as expected. You might otherwise have unexpected issues when you move to testnet. We strongly recommend reviewing these differences carefully to see if you might fall into this category.

However, not everyone will need to use the local development environment.
Optimism is [EVM equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), which means that Optimism looks almost exactly like Ethereum under the hood.
If you don't fall into one of the above categories, you can probably get away with simply relying on existing testing tools like Truffle or Hardhat.
If you don't know whether or not you should be using the development environment, feel free to hop into the [Optimism discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io).
Someone nice will help you out!

## What does it include?

Everything you need to test your Optimistic application:

1. An L1 (Ethereum) node available at [http://localhost:9545](http://localhost:9545).
1. An L2 (Optimism) node available at [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545).
1. All of the Optimism contracts and services that make L1 â‡” L2 communication possible.
1. Accounts with lots of ETH on both L1 and L2.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to have the following installed:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). these directions were verified with version 20.10.17

To compile the software on your own you also need:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), version 12 or later
1. [Classic Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

## Setting up the environment

We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) to run our development environment.

On a Linux system you can get the appropriate versions using these steps:


1. Install Docker. 
   If you prefer not to use the convenience script shown below, there are other installation methods.

   ```sh
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   sudo sh get-docker.sh
   ```

1. Configure Docker permissions.
   Note that these permissions do not take effect until you log in again, so you need to open a new command line window.

   ```sh
   sudo usermod -a -G docker `whoami`
   ```

::: tip There is no need to install docker-compose anymore
It is now available on Docker itself as `docker compose`
:::



## Getting the software

You can set up your development environment either by downloading the required software from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ethereumoptimism) or by building the software from the [source code](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism).
Downloading images from Docker Hub is easier and more reliable and is the recommended solution.

### Downloading from Docker Hub

1. Clone and enter the [Optimism monorepo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism):

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism.git
   cd optimism
   ```

2. Move into the `ops` directory:

   ```sh
   cd ops
   ```

3. Download the images:

   ```sh
   docker compose pull
   ``` 

4. Wait for the download to complete. This can take a while.

Depending on your machine, this startup process may take some time and it can be unclear when the system is fully ready.


## Accessing the environment

The local development environment consists of both an L1 node and an L2 node.
You can interact with these nodes at the following ports:

- L1 (Ethereum) node: [http://localhost:9545](http://localhost:9545)
- L2 (Optimism) node: [http://localhost:8545](http://localhost:8545)

## Getting ETH for transactions

::: warning WARNING
The private keys for the accounts used within the local development environment are **PUBLICLY KNOWN**.
Any funds sent to these accounts on a live network (Ethereum, Optimism, or any other public network) **WILL BE LOST**.
:::

All accounts that are funded by default within [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) are funded with 5000 ETH on both L1 and L2.
These accounts are derived from the following mnemonic:

```
test test test test test test test test test test test junk
```

Here's the full list of accounts and their corresponding private keys:

## Accessing logs

The logs produced by the L1 and L2 nodes can sometimes be useful for debugging particularly hairy bugs.
Logs will appear in the terminal you used to start the development environment, but they often scroll too quickly to be of much use.
If you'd like to look at the logs for a specific container, you'll first need to know the name of the container you want to inspect.

Run the following command to get the name of all running containers:

```sh
docker ps -a --format '{{.Image}}\t\t\t{{.Names}}' | grep ethereumoptimism
```

The output includes two columns.
The first is the name of the **image**, and the second the name of the **container** based on that image.
Each container is essentially an instance of a particular image and you're looking for the name of the *container* that you want to inspect.

| Image | Container |
| - | - |
| ethereumoptimism/l2geth:latest | ops_verifier_1
| ethereumoptimism/l2geth:latest | ops_replica_1
| ethereumoptimism/data-transport-layer:latest | ops_dtl_1
| ethereumoptimism/batch-submitter-service:latest | ops_batch_submitter_1
| ethereumoptimism/l2geth:latest | ops_l2geth_1
| ethereumoptimism/deployer:latest | ops_deployer_1
| ethereumoptimism/hardhat:latest | ops_l1_chain_1

You can then dump the logs for a given container as follows:

```sh
docker logs <container name>
```

For example, to see the logs produced by the L1 node:

```sh
docker logs ops_l1_chain_1
```

If you'd like to follow these logs as they're being generated, run:

```sh
docker logs --follow <name of container>
```

## Getting Optimism system contract addresses

If you want to [interact with Optimism system contracts](./system-contracts.md), you'll need to know the addresses of the contracts that are deployed on the network.

### Getting L2 contract addresses

L2 contracts are always deployed to the same addresses on every Optimism network.
You can simply look at [the L2 contract addresses for the mainnet Optimism network](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments/mainnet#layer-2-contracts) and you'll have the addresses for your local environment.

### Getting L1 contract addresses

Optimism's L1 contracts are deployed to different addresses on different networks.
However, the addresses for your local environment will always be the same, even if you reset the environment.
You can get the addresses for your environment with the following command:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/addresses.json
```

You should get back a JSON object that contains a mapping of contract names to contract addresses.
These addresses should not change, even if you restart your environment.
