How do you use your favorite tools for building contracts when you're working with Optimism?
Just use them!

<!--
TODO: We need a page on EVM equivalence.
-->

Optimism isn't just EVM compatible, it's EVM *equivalent*.
All the Ethereum tooling you know and love should work on Optimism without lots of fiddling.
Hardhat? Brownie? Truffle?
Yep, yep, and yep.
If you find a tool that *doesn't* seem to work with Optimism out of the box, try [opening an issue over on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/issues).
Someone working on Optimism will probably help fix the issue pretty quickly.

## Hardhat

Configuring Hardhat to deploy your contracts to Optimism is a breeze.
Simply add the following to your Hardhat config file:

```js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    ...
    // for mainnet
    'optimism': {
      url: "https://mainnet.optimism.io",
      accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2, ...]
    },
    // for testnet
    'optimism-goerli': {
      url: "https://goerli.optimism.io",
      accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2, ...]
    },
    // for the local dev environment
    'optimism-local': {
      url: "http://localhost:8545",
      accounts: [privateKey1, privateKey2, ...]
    },
  },
  ...
}
```

## Foundry

[Foundry](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/12/introducing-the-foundry-ethereum-development-toolbox) is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.
Foundry supports Optimism out of the box! 
Just provide an Optimism RPC:

```sh
forge create ... --rpc-url=https://goerli.optimism.io/
```

Additionally, you can use [forge-optimism](https://github.com/tarrencev/forge-optimism) to simulate the optimism context and simplify testing.

## Truffle

Configuring Truffle is easy too:

```js
const HDWalletProvider = require('@truffle/hdwallet-provider')

...
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    ...
    // for mainnet
    'optimism': {
      provider: () => {
        return new HDWalletProvider(YOUR_MAINNET_MNEMONIC_GOES_HERE, 'https://mainnet.optimism.io')
      }
      network_id: "10"
    },
    // for testnet
    'optimism-goerli': {
      provider: () => {
        return new HDWalletProvider(YOUR_GOERLI_MNEMONIC_GOES_HERE, 'https://goerli.optimism.io')
      }
      network_id: "420"
    },
    // for the local dev environment
    'optimism-local': {
      provider: () => {
        return new HDWalletProvider('test test test test test test test test test test test junk', 'http://localhost:8545')
      }
      network_id: "420"
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

## Brownie

[Brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) is a Python-based development and testing framework for EVM smart contracts. Brownie supports Optimism out of the box! 


## Waffle

Starting from [Waffle](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/Waffle) v4.x.x you can use Waffle chai matchers to test your smart contracts on Optimism. We recommend following [this guide](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/getting-started)(scroll down to `Waffle` section) to get to know [Waffle](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/Waffle).

If you want to add [Waffle](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/Waffle) to an already existing project, you can install it with (replace `npm install` with the package manager's you're using relevant command):

```bash
npm install --save-dev ethereum-waffle@alpha @ethereum-waffle/optimism@alpha
```

## Alchemy

[Alchemy](https://docs.alchemy.com/reference/optimism-api-quickstart) provides a stateless and lightweight JSON-RPC standard API to interact with on-chain data and send different types of transactions to the Optimism network. Getting started with Alchemy:

```bash
npm install alchemy-sdk
```

Once installed, connecting to the Optimism Network with the Alchemy SDK is simple:

```js
const { Network, Alchemy } = require("alchemy-sdk");

const settings = {
  apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your Alchemy API Key.
  network: Network.OPT_MAINNET, // Replace with your network.
};
```
