title: Using the Standard Bridge
lang: en-US
---

Certain interactions, like transferring ETH and ERC20 tokens between the two networks, are common enough that we've built the "Standard Bridge" to make moving these assets between L1 and L2 as easy as possible.

The standard bridge functionality provides a method for an ERC20 token to be deposited and locked on L1 in exchange of the same amount of an equivalent token on L2. This process is known as "bridging a token", e.g. depositing 100 USDC on L1 in exchange for 100 USDC on L2 and also the reverse - withdrawing 100 USDC on L2 in exchange for the same amount on L1. In addition to bridging tokens the standard bridge is also used for ETH.

The Standard Bridge is composed of two main contracts the [`L1StandardBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/master/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol) (for Layer 1) and the [`L2StandardBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/master/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol) (for Layer 2).

Here we'll go over the basics of using this bridge to move ERC20 assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2.

## Deposits

::: warning NOTICE
We're working hard to get more smart contract wallet software deployed and tested on Optimism.
However, as a safety measure, **we currently block smart contract wallets from calling the `depositETH` and `depositERC20` functions**.
If you want to deposit using a smart contract wallet and you know what you're doing, you can use the `depositETHTo` and `depositERC20To` functions instead.

### Depositing ERC20s

ERC20 deposits into L2 can be triggered via the `depositERC20` and `depositERC20To` functions on the [`L1StandardBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol).
You **must** approve the Standard Token Bridge to use the amount of tokens that you want to deposit or the deposit will fail.

Note that the bridge does *not* support certain ERC-20 configurations:

- [Fee on transfer tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer)
- [Tokens that modify balances without emitting a Transfer event](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#balance-modifications-outside-of-transfers-rebasingairdrops)

::: danger Use the standard bridge contract only with standard bridge tokens
The standard bridge can only be used with tokens that have a properly configured ERC-20 version on Optimism.
If you send any other type of token to the standard bridge directly (not using the user interface or the API), it gets stuck there and you lose that value.

Note that if you use the [Optimism bridge UI](https://app.optimism.io/bridge), or the [Optimism SDK](../../sdk/js-client.md) it automatically chooses the correct bridge contract, so this problem does not happen.

There are two ways to check if a token can use the standard bridge:

1. Look in [the token list](https://static.optimism.io/optimism.tokenlist.json). 
   If a token can use the standard bridge, then the `"chainId": 10` entry will have the standard L2 bridge address, `0x4200..0010`. For example, this entry shows that on the main Optimism network `0xBTC` can use the standard bridge.

   ```json
       {
      "chainId": 10,
      "address": "0xe0BB0D3DE8c10976511e5030cA403dBf4c25165B",
      "name": "0xBitcoin",
      "symbol": "0xBTC",
      "decimals": 8,
      "logoURI": "https://ethereum-optimism.github.io/data/0xBTC/logo.png",
      "extensions": {
        "optimismBridgeAddress": "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000010"
      }
    },
   ```

   In the token exists in the token list but does not use the standard bridge, the `extensions.optimismBridgeAddress` value is different. For example, this entry shows that on the main Optimism network `DAI` uses a different bridge:

   ```json
       {
      "chainId": 10,
      "address": "0xDA10009cBd5D07dd0CeCc66161FC93D7c9000da1",
      "name": "Dai stable coin",
      "symbol": "DAI",
      "decimals": 18,
      "logoURI": "https://ethereum-optimism.github.io/data/DAI/logo.svg",
      "extensions": {
        "optimismBridgeAddress": "0x467194771dAe2967Aef3ECbEDD3Bf9a310C76C65"
      }
    },
   ```

1. You can "ask" the L2 token contract by calling it. 
   ERC-20 tokens that can use the standard bridge not only if they:
   - Have an `l2Bridge` method
   - That method returns `0x4200...0010`. 

   For example, [this link](https://explorer.optimism.io/address/0xe0bb0d3de8c10976511e5030ca403dbf4c25165b#readContract) can be used to see that `0xBTC` uses the standard bridge.

   Note that you cannot query the L1 token contract the same way.
   L2 contracts know the identity of their L1 counterpart, but L1 contracts only need to implement the standard ERC-20 methods.

### Depositing ETH

ETH deposits into L2 can be triggered via the `depositETH` and `depositETHTo` functions on the [`L1StandardBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol).
ETH deposits can alternatively be triggered by sending ETH directly to the `L1StandardBridge`.
Once your deposit is detected and finalized on Optimism, your account will be funded with the corresponding amount of ETH on L2.

## Withdrawals

### Withdrawing ERC20s

ERC20 withdrawals can be triggered via the `withdraw` or `withdrawTo` functions on the [`L2StandardBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol).
If you'd like to see this contracts in action, you should check out the [L1 â‡” L2 deposit-and-withdraw example](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/cross-dom-bridge-erc20).

### Withdrawing ETH

Unlike on L1, we do not have a separate function on L2 for withdrawing ETH.
Instead, you can use the `withdraw` or `withdrawTo` functions on the [`L2StandardBridge`](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol) and use the address `0xDeadDeAddeAddEAddeadDEaDDEAdDeaDDeAD0000` as the L2 token address.

## Adding an ERC20 token to the Standard Bridge

::: tip
To add your token to the standard bridge, see the guide [Adding an ERC20 token to the Standard Bridge](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/standard-bridge-standard-token).
:::

## The Superchain token list

The Standard bridge allows a one-to-many mapping between L1 and L2 tokens, meaning that there can be many Optimism implementations of an L1 token.
However there is always a one-to-one mapping between L1 and L2 tokens in the [Superchain token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/blob/master/optimism.tokenlist.json).
The Superchain token list is used as the source of truth for the [Optimism bridge UI](https://app.optimism.io/bridge/deposit) which is the main portal for moving assets between Layer 1 and Layer 2.

If you want to have your token added to the Superchain token list, you must make a pull request against the [Superchain token list repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io#adding-a-token-to-the-list).
You'll need the addresses for both the L1 and L2 tokens, as well as a logo for the token.
If you're looking for an example to follow, take a look at [this simple pull request that adds a token to the token list](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ethereum-optimism.github.io/pull/43/files).
