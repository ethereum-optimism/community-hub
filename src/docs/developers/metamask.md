## Connecting manually

Alternatively, it's pretty easy to manually add a network to MetaMask.
First, take a look at our [Networks and Connection Details](./networks) page and figure out which network you'd like to connect to.
Then, follow these three easy steps:

1. Open the MetaMask browser extension and click on the network name at the top of the pane:

3. Now you'll be prompted to input your connection details. Make sure to refer to the [Networks and Connection Details](./networks) page and input the details for your desired network:

Once you hit `save`, you'll be automatically connected to the network.
You're ready to play with Optimistic Ethereum!

Make sure you've correctly inputted all of your network details.
In particular, make sure the chain ID you entered is correct.
