This document provides an overview of how to deploy a Bedrock node. To learn more about how Bedrock itself works and its motivations, please see [the specs on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/tree/65ec61dde94ffa93342728d324fecf474d228e1f/specs).

This document is designed to be a general overview of how to deploy a Bedrock node. 

## Deployment Overview

A Bedrock deployment consists of two core components: 

1. The Rollup Node, which is responsible for deriving blocks from L1 and passing them to the Execution engine. It also participates in a peer-to-peer network that synchronizes unsubmitted blocks as the sequencer creates them. We refer to this component as `op-node`.
2. The Execution Engine, which is responsible for executing the blocks it receives from the rollup node and storing state. It also exposes standard JSON-RPC methods to query blockchain data and submit transactions to the network. We refer to this component as `op-geth`, since our Execution Engine is [a minimal fork](https://op-geth.optimism.io/) of `go-ethereum`.

The Rollup Node and Execution Engine communicate with each other over JSON-RPC via the Engine API. This is similar to how regular Ethereum networks are deployed. The Rollup Node functions as Optimism's consensus client, and the Execution Engine as its execution client.

For OP Mainnet and OP Goerli (but not OP Sepolia), you may also need to run a third component called Legacy Geth. Legacy Geth is used to serve execution traces for transactions prior to the Bedrock upgrade, which we refer to as "historical transactions". When the Rollup Node encounters an RPC call that requires historical execution traces, it will forward the request to Legacy Geth. Note, however, that unlike our previous networks requests for historical _data_ will be served by the Execution Engine directly. This distinction will be clarified later on in this document.

The architecture of a typical Bedrock deployment looks like this:

</div>

## System Requirements

We recommend the following minimum system requirements to run Bedrock:

- `op-node`: Minimum 2CPUs, 4GB RAM. No storage is necessary.
- `op-geth`: Minimum 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM. At least 40GB of storage is required for OP Goerli or OP Sepolia. At least 600GB of storage is required for mainnet. Storage must be SSD. Requirements are significantly higher for archive nodes.

## Getting the Software

`op-geth` and `op-node` are available as Docker images. Consult the [documentation](./public-testnets.md) for the network you are participating in to get the correct image tag.

Legacy Geth uses version `0.5.31` of our old `l2geth` image.

You can also compile `op-geth` and `op-node` from source.

## Node Configuration

:::warning
Always run `op-node` and `op-geth` in a one-to-one configuration. Don't run multiple `op-geth` instances behind one `op-node`, or vice versa.
:::

To configure your node, you will need to do the following:

1. Configure `op-node` to point to the correct L1, `op-geth`, and L2 network.
2. Initialize `op-geth` with the correct network parameters.
3. Configure `op-geth` to properly communicate with the Rollup Node.
4. Optionally, configure Legacy Geth.

### Configuring op-geth

:::tip
Even though the Docker image for the Execution Engine is called `op-geth`, the actually binary is still called `geth` in order to minimize differences between `op-geth` and `go-ethereum`.
:::

We'll start with `op-geth`'s configuration because it is more complex. As mentioned before, `op-geth` is a minimal fork of `go-ethereum`. As a result, it stores its state in a database that requires initialization. Initialization is done one of two ways, depending on which network you're deploying:

1. **With a Genesis File:** This is for OP Sepolia, and other testnets or deployments that are not migrated from a legacy network. In this case, you'll download the genesis file and initialize the data directory via `geth init`.
2. **With a Data Directory:** This is used for networks that are migrated from a legacy network. This would include OP Mainnet and OP Goerli. In this case, you'll download a preconfigured data directory and extract it. No further initialization is necessary in this case, because the data directory contains the network's genesis information. 

Regardless of how `op-geth` is initialized, you'll need to ensure that you have sufficient disk space available to store the network's data. As of this writing, the mainnet data directory is ~100GB for a full node and ~1TB for an archival node. The OP Goerli data directory is ~40GB for a full node.

Instructions for each initialization method are below. If you're spinning up an OP Mainnet or OP Goerli node, use the [Initialization via Data Directory](#initialization-via-data-directory) path. If you're spinning up an OP Sepolia node, use the [Initialization via Genesis File](#initialization-via-genesis-file) path.

#### Initialization via Genesis File

`op-geth` uses JSON files to encode a network's genesis information. Unlike OP Mainnet and OP Goerli, the genesis for OP Sepolia is not currently included in the `op-geth` binary. For networks that are initialized in this way, you'll receive a URL to the genesis JSON. You'll need to download the genesis JSON, then run the following command to initialize the data directory:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
FILE=/$DATADIR/genesis.json
OP_GETH_GENESIS_URL=https://storage.googleapis.com/oplabs-network-data/Sepolia/genesis.json

if [ ! -s $FILE ]; then
  apk add curl
  curl $OP_GETH_GENESIS_URL -o $FILE
  geth init --datadir /db $FILE
else
  echo "Genesis file already exists. Skipping initialization."
fi
```

::: danger CLI Flag Requirements
Required: `--sepolia`

Do not set:   `--rollup.historicalrpc` and `rollup.historicalrpctimeout`
:::

#### Initialization via Data Directory

To initialize `op-geth` with a preconfigured data directory, simply download and extract the data directory to a place of your choosing. The data directory is exported as a tar file. An example command to do this is below:

```bash
curl -o <path to data directory> -sL <URL to data directory>
tar -xvf <path to data directory>
```

#### Configuration

Once `op-geth` is initialized, it can be configured via CLI flags. `op-geth` accepts all the [standard `go-ethereum` flags](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interface/command-line-options) as well as a few extra flags that are specific to Optimism. These flags are:

- `--rollup.historicalrpc`: Enables the historical RPC endpoint. This endpoint is used to fetch historical execution data from Legacy Geth. This flag is only necessary for upgraded networks.
- `--rollup.sequencerhttp`: HTTP endpoint of the sequencer. `op-geth` will route `eth_sendRawTransaction` calls to this URL. Bedrock does not currently have a public mempool, so this is required if you want your node to support transaction submission. Consult the documentation for the network you are participating in to get the correct URL.
- `--rollup.disabletxpoolgossip`: Disables transaction pool gossiping. While not required, it's useful to set this to `true` since transaction pool gossip is currently unsupported.

To communicate with `op-node` and enable the Engine API, you'll also need to generate a JWT secret file and enable Geth's authenticated RPC endpoint.

To generate the JWT secret, run the following:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwt.txt
```

Then, specify the following flags:

- `--authrpc.addr`: Sets the address `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC should listen on.
- `--authrpc.port`: Sets the port `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC should listen on. The default value is `8551`.
- `--authrpc.jwtsecret`: Sets the path to a JWT secret file you generated above.
- `--syncmode=full`: This prevents Geth from attempting to snap sync. Snap sync is currently unsupported, but will be enabled shortly after the mainnet upgrade.
- `--maxpeers=0`: This prevents Geth from peering with other Geth nodes. Execution-layer peering is currently unsupported, but will be added as part of enabling snap sync.
- `--nodiscover`: This disables Geth's peer discovery mechanism. Execution-layer discovery is currently unsupported, but will be added as part of enabling snap sync.

#### Optional op-geth Configuration

You may also want to specify the following flags based on your configuration:

- `--authrpc.vhosts`: Whitelists which hosts (as defined in the `Host` header) are allowed to access the authenticated RPC endpoint. This is useful if you're running `op-geth` on containerized infrastructure. The default value is `localhost`.
- `--http.vhosts`: Whitelists which hosts (as defined in the `Host` header) are allowed to access the unauthenticated RPC endpoint. This is useful if you're running `op-geth` on containerized infrastructure. The default value is `localhost`.
- `--http`, `--http.addr`, and `--http.port`: Enables the unauthenticated RPC endpoint, configures its address, and configures its port. You'll almost certainly want to specify these, since they will enable Geth's JSON-RPC endpoint.
- `--ws`, `--ws.addr`, and `--ws.port`: Enables the WebSocket API.
- `--verbosity`: Configures Geth's log level. This is a number between 0 and 5, with 5 being the most verbose. Defaults to 3.

#### Working Base Configuration

A valid command that runs `op-geth` on our `beta-1` network and enables RPC over HTTP and WebSockets looks like:

```bash
geth \
  --ws \
  --ws.port=8546 \
  --ws.addr=localhost \
  --ws.origins="*" \
  --http \
  --http.port=8545 \
  --http.addr=localhost \
  --http.vhosts="*" \
  --http.corsdomain="*" \
  --authrpc.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=/var/secrets/jwt.txt \
  --authrpc.port=8551 \
  --authrpc.vhosts="*" \
  --datadir=/data \
  --verbosity=3 \
  --rollup.disabletxpoolgossip=true \
  --rollup.sequencerhttp=https://bedrock-beta-1-sequencer.optimism.io \
  --nodiscover \
  --syncmode=full \
  --maxpeers=0
```

Consult [Geth's documentation](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/) for more information on customizing `op-geth`'s behavior.

### Configuring op-node

`op-node` is a standalone, statically linked binary. It stores no state, and requires no initialization. It consumes configuration parameters either via the command line or environment variables. For some networks, the Rollup Node also requires a configuration file (called `rollup.json` or the "rollup config") that configures network-specific genesis parameters. For official networks like OP Goerli, OP Sepolia, and OP Mainnet, the genesis config is hardcoded in the `op-node` software and can be specified via a `--network` flag.

A minimal valid configuration for a rollup node on our `op sepolia` testnet looks like this:

```bash
op-node --l1=<sepolia RPC url> \
        --l2=<op-geth authenticated RPC url> \
        --network=sepolia \
        --rpc.addr=127.0.0.1 \
        --rpc.port=9545 \
        --l2.jwt-secret=<path to JWT secret>
```

You can manually specify a path to a rollup config with the `--rollup.config` flag. This is used for testnets or internal deployments that are not migrated from a legacy network.

Each of the above flags can also be defined via an environment variable. Run `op-node --help` to see a list of all available flags and environment variables.

#### Configuring Peer-to-Peer Networking

Unlike the previous system, the `op-node` participates in a peer-to-peer network. This network is used to distribute blocks that have not been submitted to L1 yet. The `op-node` will automatically discover and connect to peers using a hardcoded set of bootnodes. You can also manually specify peers to connect to via the `--p2p.static` flag.

For best results, run `op-node` with a static IP address that is accessible from the public Internet. For Kubernetes deployments, this can be achieved by configuring a dedicated `Ingress` with an external IP, and using the `--p2p.advertise.ip` flag to specify the IP address of the load balancer when advertising IP addresses to peers.

The default port for the peer-to-peer network is `9003`. You will need to open this port on your firewall to receive unsubmitted blocks. For your node to be discoverable, this port must be accessible via both TCP and UDP protocols.

### Legacy Geth

If you are running a node for an upgraded network like OP Mainnet or OP Goerli (but not OP Sepolia), you will also need to run Legacy Geth in order to serve historical execution traces. Fundamentally, Legacy Geth is our old `l2geth` binary running against a preconfigured data directory. To configure Legacy Geth, follow the instructions above for using a preconfigured data directory, then execute the following command:

:::danger
It is imperative that you specify the `USING_OVM=true` environment variable in the command below. Failing to specify this will cause `l2geth` to return invalid execution traces, or panic at startup.
:::

```bash
USING_OVM=true \
  ETH1_SYNC_SERVICE_ENABLE=false \
  RPC_API=eth,rollup,net,web3,debug \
  RPC_ADDR=0.0.0.0 \
  RPC_CORS_DOMAIN=* \
  RPC_ENABLE=true \
  RPC_PORT=8545 \
  RPC_VHOSTS=* \
  geth --datadir <path to data directory>
```

This command is the minimum required to run Legacy Geth and expose a functioning RPC endpoint. As before, `l2geth` takes all standard `go-ethereum` flags so you can customize the configuration as needed.

As mentioned above, don't forget to specify `--rollup.historicalrpc` on `op-geth` to properly route requests for historical execution to Legacy Geth.

Since Legacy Geth is read-only, it is safe to run multiple Legacy Geth nodes behind a load balancer.

#### Historical Execution vs. Historical Data Routing

Only requests for historical execution will be routed to Legacy Geth. 
Everything else will be served by `op-geth` directly.
The term _historical execution_ refers to RPC methods that need to execute transactions prior to bedrock (not just read data from the database):

- `eth_call`
- `eth_estimateGas`
- `debug_traceBlockByNumber`
- `debug_traceBlockByHash`
- `debug_traceCall`
- `debug_traceTransaction`

If you do not need these RPC methods for historical data, then you do not need to run Legacy Geth at all.


## Troubleshooting

### 401 Unauthorized: Signature Invalid

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
WARN [12-13|15:53:20.263] Derivation process temporary error       attempts=80 err="stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: failed to fetch current L2 forkchoice state: failed to find the finalized L2 block: failed to determine L2BlockRef of finalized, could not get payload: 401 Unauthorized: signature is invalid
```

It means that the `op-node` is unable to authenticate with `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC using the JWT secret. To fix:

1. Check that the JWT secret is correct in both services.
2. Check that `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC is enabled, and that the URL is correct.

### 403 Forbidden: Invalid Host Specified

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
{"err":"403 Forbidden: invalid host specified\n","lvl":"error","msg":"error getting latest header","t":"2022-12-13T22:29:18.932833159Z"}
```

It means that you have not whitelisted `op-node`'s host with `op-geth`. To fix:

1. Make sure that the `--authrpc.vhosts` parameter in `op-geth` is either set to the correct host, or `*`.
2. Check that `op-geth`'s authenticated RPC is enabled, and that the URL is correct.

### Failed to Load P2P Config

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
CRIT [12-13|13:46:21.386] Application failed                       message="failed to load p2p config: failed to load p2p discovery options: failed to open discovery db: mkdir /p2p: permission denied"
```

It means that the `op-node` does not have write access to the P2P discovery or peerstore directories. To fix:

1. Make sure that the `op-node` has write access to the P2P directory. By default, this is `/p2p`.
2. Set the P2P directory to somewhere the `op-node` can access via the `--p2p.discovery.path` and `--p2p.peerstore.path` parameters.
3. Set the discovery path to `memory` to disable persistence via the `--p2p.discovery.path` and `--p2p.peerstore.path` parameters.

### Wrong Chain

If you see a log that looks like this in `op-node`:

```
{"attempts":183,"err":"stage 0 failed resetting: temp: failed to find the L2 Heads to start from: wrong chain L1: genesis: 0x4104895a540d87127ff11eef0d51d8f63ce00a6fc211db751a45a4b3a61a9c83:8106656, got 0x12e2c18a3ac50f74d3dd3c0ed7cb751cc924c2985de3dfed44080e683954f1dd:8106656","lvl":"warn","msg":"Derivation process temporary error","t":"2022-12-13T23:31:37.855253213Z"}
```

It means that the `op-node` is pointing to the wrong chain. To fix:

1. Verify that the `op-node`'s L1 URL is pointing to the correct L1 for the given network.
2. Verify that the `op-node`'s rollup config/`--network` parameter is set to the correct network.
3. Verify that the `op-node`'s L2 URL is pointing to the correct instance of `op-geth`, and that `op-geth` is properly initialized for the given network.
