## ETHDenver 2023 

February 24th to Mar 5th, 2023

### Scaling Ethereum - Panel with Liam Horne

Our own CEO, Liam Horne joined Jesse from Base, Eva from The Graph Foundation, and Stani from Aave for a panel covering how L2s are scaling Ethereum for global adoption, moderated by Molly from Protocol Labs.

### Doing Decentralization Identity Right - Kelvin Fichter

From our DevRel team, Kelvin Fichter talked about building decentralized, attestation-based identity onchain. Come for the knowledge, stay for the slide art.

### Web3 Identity Off-Chain, On-Chain, and Both - Panel with Kelvin Fichter

He continued to share his thoughts on a panel, where he sat down Masha Healy & Evin McMullen as they all discussed Web3 identity off-chain, on-chain, or both.

### The Collective DAO Archive - Justine Humenansky

At both ETHDenver, and Schelling Point, Justine Humenansky shared findings from her months long research into DAO governance and policy. Not only did she organize her research results into 10 categories and bless us with actionable takeaways for each, she also open sourced her work! Check out her presentation and dive into [The Collective DAO Archives](https://www.notion.so/1ffe90c038a64f309af46009895495c6?ref=the-optimistic-dev-blog), a searchable library of DAO policies, programs, and processes.

### Playing the Cooperative Game Retroactively - Ben Jones 

The OP Stack, the codebase that powers Optimism, is the most overpowered public good in the game. But don’t take our word for it; you can take Ben Jones’ - aka Weird ETH Yankovic - who covered all things RetroPGF and how the OP Stack fits into the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

## ETHOnline 2022 | Optimism Summit

September 22nd, 2022

### Modular OP Stack - Karl Floersch

This talk covers the OP Stack chain software, and how the Bedrock release will enable deployments of op-chains which serve new use cases, are future proof, and will all one day fit together to form the Superchain.

### Introduction to Architecture - Joshua Gutow

This talks covers bedrock’s architecture. It explains how redesigning the rollup architecture in bedrock reduces fees & increases implementation simplicity. It also covers the various components of the system & how they interact.

### Modular sequencing - Norswap Laurent

In this video you learn the design space around two design choices related to sequencing:

- *who* sequences (decentralization)
- *how* they sequence (MEV!)

### Pluggable data availability - Protolambda

In this talk protolambda explains how the next Optimism upgrade improves the rollup with modular design, and how this can be utilized to quickly adopt future scaling improvements like EIP-4844 (a.k.a. proto-danksharding). 
OP Labs is contributing to L1 research and development to increase the data availability used for securing all L2s.

### Panel: State of 4844

The end game for data availability on Ethereum - Full Sharding - and how EIP-4844 gets us closer to that goal. This video discusses:

- Where we are with the implementation of EIP-4844 and what else was needed to be done before CFI.
- How the community could help us ship EIP-4844.
- Data Availability and the concept of a Data Availability Layer; analogous to the CL and EL. This concept helps reason about how data, i.e. the blobs, fits in Ethereum.

### Intro to Quix - Mark Dawson

The NFT ecosystem on Optimism is an exciting, growing space. 
Mark Dawson is the co-founder of Quix, the largest NFT marketplace on Optimism. 
He discusses early NFT communities on Optimism, the upcoming NFT bridge, composable NFTs, and how to get started in the OP NFT ecosystem.
