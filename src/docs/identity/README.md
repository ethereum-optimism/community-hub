## Introduction

Identity is a fundamental aspect of human experience that encompasses the relationships, interests, and values that define individuals and groups. 
However, the current online identity landscape is fragmented, non-interoperable, and controlled by centralized gatekeepers.

Decentralized identity solutions empower individuals to customize their identity according to their preferences, move it seamlessly across services, and regain control of their personal information from centralized platforms. 
These solutions are designed to enable users to prove specific attributes about themselves in a trustworthy and verifiable way, without compromising their privacy or security.

The Optimism Collective is [building a better economic engine that fuels positive-sum games](https://www.optimism.io/vision) and decentralized identity is central to that mission. 
For example, the two-house governance system of the Optimism Collective is composed of token holders and community members who participate in a one-person-one-vote system based on reputation and community contributions. 

In addition to democratic governance, decentralized identity expands the design space for innovation and gives individuals greater control over their finances, and enables them to participate in the global economy on their own terms.

## Building a decentralized identity ecosystem, together

Building decentralized identity on the Superchain involves using proof of personhood and reputation data from various sources, eliminating the need for a single entity to own user data and identity.

Through this process, anyone can use algorithms like [EigenTrust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EigenTrust) to derive identity sets based on a purely subjective web of trust. This allows for the establishment of a more trustworthy and reliable means of verifying an individual's identity in a decentralized environment.

This open-source primitive can be applied across the Superchain for a variety of Sybil-resistant applications, including democratic voting and onchain credit scoring for under-collateralized loans. By leveraging attestations in this way, developers can create more secure, transparent, and democratic systems that allow for greater participation and access for everyone.

Decentralized identity is an essential components of a more democratic, secure, and accessible web. By working together, we can establish a more diverse and trustworthy network of identities that benefits everyone, and enables new opportunities for innovation in the decentralized identity space. 

The AttestationStation serves as a key component in achieving this vision. It functions as a multiplayer database and its underlying network of attestations lays the foundation for constructing decentralized identity systems that can effectively scale and adapt to the evolving needs of users and developers.
