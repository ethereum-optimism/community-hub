- **Attestation**: Attestations are statements or evidence of information made by anyone about anything.

- **Attestation recipient:** The entity or individual that receives the attestation from the attester. 
  In decentralized identity, the attestation recipient can be a service provider, website, or any other entity that requires verification of a person's identity or personal information.

- **Attestation issuer:** The entity or individual that performs the attestation process and issues the attestation. 
  In decentralized identity, the attestation issuer can be a government agency, financial institution, or any other trusted entity that is authorized to verify a person's identity or personal information.  
  
- **Attestation verifier:** The entity or individual that verifies the attestation and ensures that it is valid and accurate. 
  In decentralized identity, the attestation verifier can be a service provider, website, or any other entity that requires verification of a person's identity or personal information.

- **AttestationStation (ATST):** AttestationStation is a decentralized, permissionless database for for creating, verifying, and revoking on/off-chain attestations on the Superchain. 
The AttestationStation uses [the EAS Standard](https://attest.sh/).

- **Decentralized identity:** A system that enables individuals to have greater control and ownership over their personal data and identity. 
  In decentralized identity, personal information is stored on a blockchain or other decentralized system, and individuals have the ability to grant or revoke access to their data as they see fit. 
  This allows for greater privacy, security, and control over personal information.
  
- **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS):** An Ethereum infrastructure public good for making attestations on or off-chain about anything. EAS is the core infrastructure used to power the AttestationStation.   
  
- **Sybil-resistance:** Sybil resistance is a defense mechanism that prevents someone from creating multiple fake identities in a decentralized identity system.

- **Web of trust:** A web of trust is a decentralized model used to establish trust among participants in a network. It relies on the concept of participants vouching for the authenticity or trustworthiness of other participants. In a web of trust, trust is built through the accumulation of attestations from trusted individuals.
