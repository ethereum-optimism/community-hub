### Promoting Values before anything else

We love to promote values-aligned projects as part of our broader content program.


### Tweeting

We do the occasional retweet but the bar for these is kept quite high in order to keep our Twitter feed as valuable/high signal as possible. 
Other than RT's, we may like or reply to a tweet or include it in our weekly wrap up thread. 
You're welcome to submit your tweet for amplification but please keep in mind if and how we interact with it is at our sole discretion.


### OPRadio

We also host a weekly Twitter Space in an interview/podcast format called OP Radio. You're welcome to express interest in being featured on OP Radio, but keep in mind that we maintain the final say on whether it makes sense or not.

 
## Governance Grants

Grants are mainly handled by [The Optimism Collective](https://app.optimism.io/announcement), our open governance system/digital society. If you are interested in applying, we first recommend the following: 
 
- Check that your application falls within the possible Governance Grant categories in the [OPerating manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual/blob/main/manual.md#valid-proposal-types).
- Deploy to OP Mainnet (we are [EVM Equivalent](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306), not just EVM compatible so it is very easy to deploy). 
  Check out our [getting started tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/getting-started) to see how to deploy. We also have [tons of more in-depth tutorials](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial) for bridging and other L2 specific functionality. 
- Try gaining organic traction:
  - Traction can be gained through our community.
  - Head over to [our discord](https://discord-gateway.optimism.io/) and check out [#showandtell](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/819333988719263774) or [#demoday](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/960493820674465883).
  Demo Day is an AMA about your product to our community. Apply in Discord. 
  - Seek synergies ‚Äì look at other teams already deployed on OP Mainnet that could work with your product and reach out to them.
- Once you have done the above, check out our [governance grant process](https://gov.optimism.io/t/mission-applicant-guide-how-to-submit-a-mission-application/6899).
- To get reviews in real time from governance delegates go to discord and post about your project in [#gov-general](https://discord.com/channels/667044843901681675/968498307913637919).
