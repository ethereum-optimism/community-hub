::: tip Work in Progress™
Our documentation, like most things in the world, is imperfect. 
If you have questions or feel like something is missing feel free to ask in our [Discord server](https://discord.optimism.io) where we (and our awesome community) are actively responding, or [open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues) in the GitHub repo for this site.

<!--

We know documentation can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, especially when the subject matter is unfamiliar.
Let's make sure you know where to go next!

## For: Casually Interested Readers
**Are you here because you're interested in Optimistic Ethereum at a high-level?**

**We're working on a TL;DR page just for you.**

In the meantime, you might find what you're looking for in our [collection of talks and videos](/docs/resources/talks.md).

Want some suggestions?
If you're in the mood for something in-depth but lighthearted, take a look at [Optimistic Ethereum: Keeping Ethereum Half Full](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYeOW4ePgZE).
If you want something with a little more code in it, you may be interested in this [Code Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHYSZ51ATWQ) that we did live for the [2021 Scaling Ethereum hackathon](https://scaling.ethglobal.co/).

<!--
**We'd recommend starting with the [Optimistic Ethereum TL;DR](/tldr/)**.

It's got a great explanation of the protocol at a high-level.
No deep Ethereum experience necessary.

If you don't find that page to be sufficiently deep, you can always check out our page explaining the Optimistic Ethereum [protocol in detail](/docs/protocol/protocol.md).

::: tip Don't have the time for docs?
Check out this [collection of talks and videos](/docs/resources/talks.md) to help you understand Optimistic Ethereum.
We'll even throw in the fun audio and visuals for free.
It's like the world's best portable source of esoteric blockchain knowledge!

## For: Developers
**Are you a developer who wants to deploy a smart contract to Optimistic Ethereum?**

**Take a look at our guide to [Building Stuff on Optimistic Ethereum](/docs/developers/integration.md)**.

It walks you through the complete process of deploying an application to Optimistic Ethereum.
It's a lot like deploying to Ethereum, we promise.
We're working hard to make sure any changes to your software stack are relatively minimal.

If you're looking for something a else, you may wish to search through our more complete list of [Guides and Resources](/docs/resources/tutorials.md) and our catalog of [useful developer tooling](/docs/resources/tooling.md).

::: tip Itching to get started?
[Try this tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/blob/main/README.md) that highlights the experience of building on top of Optimistic Ethereum.

## For: Protocol Nerds
**Looking to understand Optimistic Ethereum in depth?**

**Head over to our [Protocol in Detail](/docs/protocol/protocol.md) page.**

You won't find a more detailed description of the system anywhere else.
This is probably most useful if you want to learn how Optimistic Ethereum works under the hood.

You definitely don't *need* to go through this material in order to build applications on top of the system.
However, it's quite fascinating stuff and we won't stop you from reading it 😊.
