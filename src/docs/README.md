We know documentation can be a bit overwhelming sometimes, especially when the subject matter is unfamiliar.
Let's make sure you know where to go next!

::: tip Heads Up
Our documentation is a rapidly improving work in progress.
If you have questions or feel like something is missing feel free to ask in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/5TaAXGn2D8) where we (and our awesome community) are actively responding, or [open an issue](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues) in the GitHub repo for this site.

## For: The Casually Interested Reader
**Are you here because you're interested in Optimistic Ethereum at a high-level?**

**We'd recommend starting with the [Optimistic Ethereum TL;DR](/docs/protocol/tldr.md)**.

It's got a great explanation of the protocol at a high-level.
No deep Ethereum experience necessary.

If you don't find that page to be sufficiently deep, you can always check out our page explaining the Optimistic Ethereum [protocol in detail](/docs/protocol/protocol.md).

::: tip Don't have the time for docs?
Check out this [collection of talks and videos](/docs/resources/talks.md) to help you understand Optimistic Ethereum.
We'll even throw in the fun audio and visuals for free.
It's like the world's best portable source of esoteric blockchain knowledge!

## For: Developers
**Are you a developer who wants to deploy a smart contract to Optimistic Ethereum?**

**Take a look at our guide to [Building on Optimistic Ethereum](/docs/developers/integration.md)**.

It takes you through the complete process of deploying an application to Optimistic Ethereum.
It's not very different from simply deploying to Ethereum.
We're working hard to make sure any changes to your software stack are relatively minimal.

If you're looking for something a else, you may wish to search through our more complete list of [Guides and Resources](/docs/resources/tutorials.md) and catalog of [useful developer tooling](/docs/resources/tooling.md).

::: tip Just want to play with the system?
Try this [straightforward tutorial](/tutorial) that highlights the experience of building on top of Optimistic Ethereum.

## For: Protocol Information
**Looking to understand Optimistic Ethereum in depth?**

**Head over to our [Protocol in Detail](/docs/protocol/protocol.md) page.**

You won't find a more detailed description of the system anywhere else.
This is probably most useful if you want to learn how Optimistic Ethereum works under the hood.

You definitely don't *need* to go through this material in order to build applications on top of the system.
However, it's quite fascinating stuff and we won't stop you from reading it 😊.
