# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Hello and welcome to the Optimism Docs!
We aim to be the best source of technical information about [Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/).
You'll find links to all of our documentation in the sidebar to the left üëà.

## What do you want to do?

### Play with some apps on Optimism

[Get Started](https://optimismhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/4413040969755-Getting-started) with setting up your wallet, and getting ETH on Optimism. Once you are all set up you can look at the [decentralized apps on Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/apps/defi).

### Build your own app on Optimism

If you want to build and deploy your own decentralized app on Optimism, it is almost identical to building on Ethereum! You just need to keep in mind some [differences](./docs/developers/build/differences.md), and a [known issue about gas pricing discrepancy](./docs/developers/known-issues.md).
You will also need to look at our [networks page](./docs/infra/networks.md) for all the RPC endpoints and network settings you'll need.

### Learn about Retroactive Public Goods Funding

[Optimism](https://optimism.io) is experimenting with a new model for funding public goods called Retroactive Public Goods Funding (aka RetroPGF).
If you're interested in learning more, check out our [retroPGF resources page](./docs/retro-pgf/resources.md).
